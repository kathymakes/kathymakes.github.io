This fast paced, 5-week workshop mixed together all sorts of engineers, medical students, architects, sculptors, designers. We tackled the prompt:\n<b>What does it mean to inhabit both physical world and virtual space?</b>\nFor this project, I worked with the fine talents of Shirlene Liew and Rana Ozdelisk. In 5 weeks, we explored everything from biometrics, paper-cut storytelling, and jello hearts—all as interfaces to connect two strangers.\n When starting off, we wondered, <b>How might we create serendipitous intimacy?</b> \n[1.png]\n[3.jpg]\n...where we brainstormed ways to create vulnerable conversations—through handwriting, voice, and controlled darkness and projection. (We also used <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html' target='_blank'>36 Questions to Fall In Love</a> to brave internet chat-roulette for the first time.)\n[spacer.png]\nWe already rely so much on text interfaces in our relationships.<b> What are other ways we can communicate presence?</b> \n[process1.png]\n[process2.png]\nWe wanted to make people feel closer to people they couldn't see, touch or hear, by transmitting vital signs. \n[spacer.png]\n<b>So, we created jelly heart molds you could talk into...</b>\n[heart-gif.gif]\n[spacer.png]\n<b>...as well as visual vignettes players could complete.</b> \n[7.png]\n[spacer.png]\nThis project was an awesome opportunity for lightning-fast prototyping and discovery. In the final week, we created a <b>stripped-down experience of just touch and sound.</b> Gallery visitors in Providence, RI sat across from an invisible partner in Cambridge, MA, and could complete part of a duet by placing their hand on the table.\n[8.jpg]\n[12.jpg]\n<br><br>{<a href='#work'>Back to All Projects</a>}"

I collaborated with Kevin Cadena and Jamar Bromley in the studio course, Computer Utopias.\n[thumb.png]\nOur team was inspired by Hypercard and SmallTalk, which informed the shape of media-making on personal computers in the 1960s and beyond. This project speculates how we might make media in 2016, on mobile devices. <a href='work/bumble/demo.m4v' target='_blank'>Watch how it works</a>.\n<br><br>\n<b>{What is the shape of mobile media?}</b>\nToday, even with responsive design, much of mobile media retrofits desktop sites to a small screen. Scrollable content is not comfortable or “native” to this device.\nOur early sketches explored hyperlinkable, inspectable cards. We envisioned a Squarespace for Thumbs, where people could create webcontent without ever touching a full-size computer.\n[2.png]\n<br>\nThe most difficult question was nailing down what media our tool would enable. Ephemeral, or invested? Individual, or collaborative?\n<br><br>\n<b>{Take 1: We made a feature-bloated canvas.}</b>\nMobile devices encourage creative manipulation of images and videos. We were drawn to playful media, and inspired by Snapchat and Kidpix. In this iteration of Bumble, users could build expressive webcards on a social network.\n[4.png]\nThe program was feature-loaded: color, text, audio, shape, stickers, and hyperlinks! But what are they making, and would they care?</b>\n<b>What we learned:</b> The timeframe for mobile content creation, in this case, was less invested than on desktop. We needed to serve this platform's attention span.\n<br><br>\n<b>{Take 2: We made it cheap, fast, and boring.}</b>\nWe challenged our initial assumption that people would want to craft tiny websites with care. We trashed all content primitives except video and scribbling.\n[6.jpg]\nOops… so we made Snapchat’s less cool cousin. We lost our initial mission, which was to redefine what it meant to make and move in a mobile web browser.\n<b>What we learned:</b> It's better to make something that 100 people love than something for the masses to ignore. Make a monopoly, not more competition.\n<br><br>\n<b>{Take 3: Storytelling redefines our vision.}</b>\nUp until this point, we struggled to articulate who would use this, and why the phone matters. Full-blown websites were too heavy-duty for mobile, and Snapchat had already been done.\n[inspiration.png]\nWe were inspired by <b>LARP culture, Choose-Your-Own Adventure, and Borges' Garden of the Forking Paths.</b>\nSo, we ditched the linear stack in favor of multidirectional movement. A forking, labryinth browser of sorts. The Bumble web is a four-directional architecture that respects the shape of your phone, and the singleness of a swipe.\n[link.png]\nUsers can see their website architecture from a birds-eye, dungeon-map view.\n[sideways.png]\nWe limited media types to video and text. Easy to make and edit without strenuous pinching and dragging.\n[create.png]\nIn our first version, Bumble serves a niche audience of <b>role-playing enthusiasts.</b> In the future, Bumble can grow to accommodate new content. Instructional threads could draw in new networks of crafty people demonstrating skills and recipes. Or, similar to Reddit, people from all over the world can respond to a single thread prompt, with infinite branches.\n<br><br>\n{<a href='#work'>Back to All Projects</a>}"

What stood out to me was how he distills nature into this pure, temporal experience. His work focuses and frames natural processes—like the sunset— so the viewer enters this almost meditative state, where they are hyper-aware of passing time.\nHere's some early research: obsessive moodboarding, drawing, and word studies.\n[process4.png]\n\n[process2.png]\nI explored pages of logomarks, starting on paper, and also playing with vectors, shadows, and cut vellum paper. \n[process1.png]\n[spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{LOGO & APPLICATION}</style>\nThe final mark references a slow, recession of light, space, and atmosphere, while winking at the “T” of Turrell.

The museum, open from 10:00AM to 6:00PM daily, issues a different colored ticket to visitors each hour. Viewed as a long strip, the tickets appear as a continuous gradient. \n[tickets-02.png]\nWhat stood out to me about the museum's location was how beautiful the surrounding wineries were. This outdoor installation would bring visitors together in a tranquil museum garden. The pool connects to an unseen irrigation system which waters the nearby vines. In this way, the piece feeds back into the terrain, the way a Turrell piece works together with nature.\n[engagement.png]\n<br><br>{<a href='#work'>Back to All Projects</a>}"
