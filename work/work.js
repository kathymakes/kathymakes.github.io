The museum, open from 10:00AM to 6:00PM daily, issues a different colored ticket to visitors each hour. Viewed as a long strip, the tickets appear as a continuous gradient. The colors, taken from the museum palette, are meant to echo the temporal radiance of the sky.\n[tickets.png]\n[spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{Abstract Garden}</style>\n My engagement piece brings visitors together in an outdoor garden which supplements Turrell’s work. I imagined a tranquil space that visitors would use to reflect and relax. The pool connects to an unseen irrigation system which waters the grape vines crawling along the trellises. In this way, the piece feeds back into the terrain, paying homage to the relationship between abstracted nature and the colorful beauty of the arid landscape.\n[engagement.png]\n"

The idea came in response to our own frustrations as college students using E-Portfolio websites to learn and file-share. We observed that many of our peers also craved a more streamlined education experience online. \n We chose Google because many universities already rely on Gmail and Drive services.
