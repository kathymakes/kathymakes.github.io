		"content":"<p style='font-size:12px;line-height:12px;'>Filed Under: Brand Identity, Print.</style>\nI rebranded the James Turrell Museum in Bodega Colome, Argentina in 6 weeks for RISD's Brand Identity studio.\nI first wanted to know more about Turrell's work. What stood out to me was how he distills nature into this pure, temporal experience. His work focuses and frames natural processes—like the sunset— so the viewer enters this almost meditative state, where they are hyper-aware of passing time.\nHere's some early research: obsessive moodboarding, drawing, and word studies.\n[process4.png]\n\n[process2.png]\nI explored pages of logomarks, starting on paper, and also playing with vectors, shadows, and cut vellum paper. \n[process1.png]\n[spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{LOGO & APPLICATION}</style>\nThe final mark references a slow, recession of light, space, and atmosphere, while winking at the “T” of Turrell. The palette is a saturated take on the gradation of daylight, and the colors of the Turrell’s native Arizona landscape.

The museum, open from 10:00AM to 6:00PM daily, issues a different colored ticket to visitors each hour. Viewed as a long strip, the tickets appear as a continuous gradient. \n[tickets-02.png]\nWhat stood out to me about the museum's location was how beautiful the surrounding wineries were. This outdoor installation would bring visitors together in a tranquil museum garden. The pool connects to an unseen irrigation system which waters the nearby vines. In this way, the piece feeds back into the terrain, the way a Turrell piece works together with nature.\n[engagement.png]\n[spacer.png]"

This fast paced, 5-week workshop mixed together all sorts of engineers, medical students, architects, sculptors, designers. We tackled the prompt:\n<b>What does it mean to inhabit both physical world and virtual space?</b>\nFor this project, I worked with the fine talents of Shirlene Liew and Rana Ozdelisk. Together, we had the following combined super powers: mech engineering, business know-how, front-end, biology, drawing, graphic design, and taxidermy even! In 5 weeks, we explored everything from biometrics, paper-cut storytelling, and jello hearts—all as interfaces to connect two strangers.\n When starting off, we wondered, <b>How might we create serendipitous intimacy?</b> \n[1.png]\n[3.jpg]\n...where we brainstormed ways to create vulnerable conversations—through handwriting, voice, and controlled darkness and projection. We also used <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html' target='_blank'>36 Questions to Fall In Love</a> to brave Omegle for the first time.\n[spacer.png]\nWe already rely so much on text interfaces in our relationships.<b> What are other ways we can communicate presence?</b> \n[process1.png]\n[process2.png]\nWe wanted to make people feel closer to people they couldn't see, touch or hear, by transmitting vital signs. \n[spacer.png]\n<b>So, we created jelly heart molds you could talk into...</b>\n[heart-gif.gif]\n[spacer.png]\n<b>...as well as visual vignettes players could complete.</b> \n[7.png]\n[spacer.png]\nIn the final week, we created a <b>stripped-down experience of just touch and sound.</b> Gallery visitors in Providence, RI sat across from an invisible partner in Cambridge, MA, and could complete part of a duet by placing their hand on the table.\n[8.jpg]\nThis project was an awesome opportunity for really fast prototyping, and diverging into wild variations—and pivoting, a lot!\n[12.jpg]\nHere's the gallery in Providence bustling on the opening night.\n[10.jpg]"
