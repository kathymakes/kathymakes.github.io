  		Ongoing work, 2020.
      I often reflect on my position as a class-privileged Chinese American art-maker, caught between romanticized narratives of Chinatowns and—by contrast—my own lived experience within tech work, economic mobility, and SAT-obsessed high schools.
      Whose working immigrant bodies do we value through our language?
      Sometimes I find myself a tourist within my extended family's own cultural or class experience. In the broader Chinese diaspora, I feel sensitive to moments when way race unifies across class, and create moments of the familiar.       <br>

      <b> GARMENT (WORK IN PROGRESS):</b> This du-dai-inspired cotton shirt was handmade by a friend. I'm slowly hand-embroidering it.
      The imagery is based on photos of a Chinatown garment worker, my mother as a tech worker, and traditional Chinese embroidery patterns.

      Inspired by Buddhist monk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh" target="_blank">Thích Nhất Hạnh</a>, I was curious about ways in which mindful activities with the body – like walking – can be a kind of art in of itself.
      Inversely, art-making can become meditative, it can center body and time in mechanical, transient ways. Think Richard Long's walks, or Goldsworthy's leaves.

      To me, moving through space in this way has always been an ancient, unnamed, beautiful art (especially outside the canon of white contemporary artists.)

      <b>ART AS CONTEMPLATIVE CARE / CONTEMPLATIVE CARE AS ART </b>

      In this 2-hour workshop, I offer space where people could consider the body while drawing. This way, drawing is more like breathing than it is image-making.

		I wrote a poem about word sounds using <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" target = "_blank">CMU's pronouncing dictionary</a>.
		There’s such a material quality to spoken word—which are just meaty vibrations, with different ways of stopping air.
    My 1-month bare bones knowledge of linguistics tells me that air stopped with my lips, versus with teeth, versus tongue, are the most low-level differentiators between sounds that are innately “aggressive,” or innately “soft.”

		[babycastles1.jpg]
		For me, the exciting computational aspect was glomming together intense similarities in record time— creating this hyper-active form of English that almost evolved into something more abstractly shaped, like music.
		[0-realpython.png]
		“Rain in spain,” was the only string that has some intentional cultural reference. Originally from “My Fair Lady,” it acts as a kind of shibboleth for lower-class dialects; there’s a whole song about her conforming her vowel dipthongs.

	// 	<b>What is the shape of mobile media?</b>
	// 	Today, even with responsive design, much of mobile media retrofits desktop sites to a small screen. Scrollable content is not comfortable or “native” to this device.
	// 	Our team was inspired by Hypercard and SmallTalk, which informed the shape of media-making on personal computers in the 1960s and beyond.
	// 	[2.png]
	// 	Our early sketches explored hyperlinkable, inspectable cards, where people could create webcontent without touching a full-size computer.
	// 	The most difficult question was nailing down <b>what media our tool would enable.</b> Ephemeral, or invested? Individual, or collaborative?
	// 	<br><br>
	// 	<b>VERSION 1</b>
	// 	Mobile devices encourage creative manipulation of images and videos. We were drawn to playful media, and inspired by Snapchat and Kidpix. In this iteration of Bumble, users could build <b>expressive webcards on a social network.</b>
	// 	[4.png]
	// 	The program was feature-loaded: color, text, audio, shape, stickers, and hyperlinks! But what are they making, and would they care?</b>
	// 	<b>What we learned:</b> The timeframe for mobile content creation, in this case, was less invested than on desktop. We needed to serve this platform's attention span.
	// 	<br><br>
	// 	<b>VERSION 2</b>
	// 	We challenged our initial assumption that people would want to craft handheld websites with care. We trashed all content primitives except video and scribbling.
	// 	[6.jpg]
	// 	Oops… so we made Snapchat’s less cool cousin. We lost our initial mission, which was to redefine what it meant to make and move in a mobile web browser.
	// 	<b>What we learned:</b> It's better to make something that 100 people love than something for the masses to ignore. Make a monopoly, not more competition.
	// 	<br><br>
	// 	<b>VERSION 3: Storytelling redefines our vision.</b>
	// 	Up until this point, we struggled to articulate who would use this, and why the phone matters. Full-blown websites were too heavy-duty for mobile, and Snapchat had already been done.

	// 	In our final iteration, we created a storytelling platform fueled by <b>LARP culture</b>.
	// 	The UI was inspired by <b>Choose-Your-Own Adventure,</b> and Borges' <b>Garden of the Forking Paths.</b>
	// 	[7.png]
	// 	The Bumble web is a four-directional architecture that respects the shape of your phone, and the singleness of a swipe. Users can see their website architecture from a birds-eye, dungeon-map view.

	// 	<br>
	// 	{<video src='work/bumble/demo.m4v' controls autoplay='on'></video>.}

	// 	In our first version, Bumble serves a niche audience of <b>role-playing enthusiasts.</b> In the future, Bumble can grow to accommodate new content. Instructional threads could draw in new networks of crafty people demonstrating skills and recipes. Or, similar to Reddit, people from all over the world can respond to a single thread prompt, with infinite branches.

  How much does the internet weigh? How much data do we consume?<br>Are their landfills of information on the internet?
[intro_bytes_reduced.png]

  This project began as a investigation of the textual internet.  Over a semester, it evolved into a visceral experience of virtual data, including installation, video, and writing.




  <br><br>
  <b>1. VOLUME, WEIGHT</b>

  If our informational input could be measured in pounds, imagine how it would feel to literally consume or hold that much weight.

  In early explorations, I translated data into sculptural objects with mass to expand the abstract idea of "gigabyte" or "terabyte," into a sensory one.

  [dp_1.png]
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>2. CONVERSION TOOLS</b>
  The human body understands the material world and has unique intuitions that help us navigate it. I was interested in how people would use intuition to convert their understanding of virtual units into physical objects.
 I created interpretive “conversion tools” n the form of frames and boxes. Ech of these symbolized a space for an assigned virtual unit where people’s responses/objects would live.
  [crowdsourced.png]


  <br>
  <br>
  <b>3. WRITING</b>
  Writing was an important part of my process and discovery. I generated about 1MB worth of text and images throughout this project.       I populated that data into a <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzXTWcuY86iYcHFTREVrbVhrRzA/view?usp=sharing
' target='_blank'>process document</a> and a video (below).
  In the Byte Catalogue, I documented objects I crowd-sourced. I compared these against virtual experiences—for example, the Lord of the Rings trilogy in bytes.
  [dp_2.png]
  {<video src ='work/dp/video_2.m4v' controls autoplay='on' muted width='98%' height='300' style='border:1px solid #e0e0e0'></video>}


  <br>
  <br>
  <b>4. OWNERSHIP OF VIRTUAL THINGS</b>
  Inspired by the Million Dollar website,  I was amused at the skeuomorph of buying “space” on the Internet.
  [7_alt.png]
  <br>
  I allocated pixel acre-age on my site for people to own, with a corresponding deed modeled after traditional land deeds.
  [dp_3.png]


  <br>
  <br>
  <b>5. VIRTUAL WORLD</b>
  Eventually I collected enough to fill up a room with artifacts. I found textual objects and materials of different weights and densities and quantified them in bytes.
  The piece also featured sculptural metaphors like downloading across glass jars, as well as plastic physical hard-drives.
