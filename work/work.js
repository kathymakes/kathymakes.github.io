The final mark and identity are a culmination of weeks’ worth of research about the museum environment, Turrell’s work, and design which successfully exemplified similar concepts as his. It was challenging to represent a well-known artist whose work dealt with abstract concepts of light and time. \nI strove for a visual direction which complemented his work without eclipsing its unique grandeur. The final mark references a slow, recession of light, space, and atmosphere, while winking at the “T” of Turrell. The palette is a saturated take on the gradation of daylight, and the colors of the Turrell’s native Arizona landscape. \n[turrell-01.svg]\n[turrell-02.svg]\n[spacer.png]\n <p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{Applications}</style>\n{Stationary, website, seasonal brochures, poster, & postcards.}\n[stationary.jpg]\n[webstuff.jpg]\n[brochures.jpg]\n[poster.jpg]\n[turrell12.png]\n[spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{Temporal tickets}</style>\nThe way a Turrell piece transforms when viewed during different times of the day inspired these dynamic tickets. The museum, open from 10:00AM to 6:00PM daily, issues a different colored ticket to visitors each hour. Viewed as a long strip, the tickets appear as a continuous gradient. The colors, taken from the museum palette, are meant to echo the temporal radiance of the sky.\n[tickets-03.png]\n[spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{Abstract Garden}</style>\n This outdoor museum engagement piece brings visitors together in an outdoor garden which supplements Turrell’s work. I imagined a tranquil space that visitors would use to reflect and relax. The pool connects to an unseen irrigation system which waters the grape vines crawling along the trellises. In this way, the piece feeds back into the terrain, paying homage to the relationship between abstracted nature and the colorful beauty of the arid landscape.\n[engagement.png]\n[spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{PROCESS}</style>\n[process3.jpg]\n[process1.jpg]\n"

According to Zen egaltarianism, nothing has any inherent value, positive or negative. Therefore, a simple stone is no more or less worthy of contemplation than gems or precious metals.\nHere, each layer of the unwrapping process contributes to the ultimate height of anticipation. The more the recipient invests in the unpackaging process, the more value he or she projects onto the thing inside. Ultimately, the subversion of expectation makes us look twice at an object we'd normally overlook.
