      A cross-seas collaboration with my friend Ying Cai.

      The embroidery (by me) tells two migration stories divided across economic class and held by culture. A garment worker in NYC Chinatown on the left; my mother designing semiconductors on the right. Both of them, immigrant bodies within a context of mass production.

      In the center, a child who is born in America.

      [me1.jpg]

      The hand-dyed garment is made by Ying. She's so beautifully synthesized the Chinese Du-dou silhouette with the Western apron. The shape holds stories of domesticity, Confucian patriarchy, female labor.
      In her words, yellow is a strong but gentle color.

      Whose working immigrant bodies do we value through our language?
      Sometimes I find myself a tourist within my extended family's own cultural or class experience. In the broader Chinese diaspora, I feel sensitive to moments when way race unifies across class, and create moments of the familiar.

      What’s the opposite of darkness? Is it brightness? How about the opposite of a wall, or a cage?
      Our collective imagination is constrained by our vocabulary, both linguistic and visual— can we use new art forms and new language to build the inverse of violence?
      
      [prompt.jpg]

      I designed and led this workshop series around creating speculative artwork based on "inverted" headlines. By playing with words and their opposites, we can begin rewrite current news headlines into alternative realities and speculative futures.  

      This workshop concept inspired by <a href="http://theamericanjournalofpoetry.com/v2-constantine.html" target="_blank">this poem</a> by Brendan Constantine.

      <br><br>
      <b>PT 1: THE OPPOSITE OF A GUN</b>
      I first piloted this workshop at Tisch School of Arts. I introduced the poem by Brendan Constantine, and took people through an exercise:
      “What is the opposite of the phrase, My Life Had Stood a Loaded Gun?”
       [workshop3.jpg]
        I left this Henning Rogge photo on-screen— a bomb-scar from WWII, in the forest, now teeming with life. Is this the opposite of war?
        I provided foraged materials. to “build an object that is the opposite of a gun.”
       [workshop1.jpg]
       Here is what people made: a vase for holding life; a grenade filled with woodland seeds instead of warfare; a listening device to help you hear the forest.
      [workshop2.jpg]

      <br><br>
      <b>PT 2: REWRITING HEADLINES</b>
      In the second iteration of this workshop, I placed a stronger emphasis on writing. I asked participants to look up news headlines which contained the following words:
      [workshop4.jpg]

      This version of the workshop was focused on multi-media interpretations. Here's one interpretation, using front-end browser tools as a vehicle for expression and pretend:
      <b>“Crew Hang Giant American Flag Over George Washington Bridge”</b> becomes <b>“Individual Lifts Tiny Worldwide Cloud Under Donald Trump Wall”</b>
      [opposites.gif]
      ...which later became an interactive digital project:

      <br>
      <b>MORE EXAMPLES </b>
      “These Gun Enthusiasts at the Virginia Rally Carried More Firepower than US Troops” becomes “These seed supporters at the stateless sleepover dispersed more waterpower than many Pangaea flowers”

“Gun Makers Adjust Focus to Women Buyers” becomes “Watering Can Fixers Keep Distraction Away From Baby Philanthropists”

      "content":`
      A piece of film-based transmedia storytelling I created together with Nancy Valladares and Alia Rizvi.
      This work was created as part of a social media campaign to protest the construction of a copper mine in Oak Flat, Arizona—or what is the unceded indigenous land of the San Carlos Apache people. The prompt was to create original content and present it in a short film.
      [oakflat2.gif] 

    These extractive processes threaten all life because they threaten water. Our film features a poem I wrote from the point of view of the river basin. I contributed to the concept, and created about half of the video graphics using digital collage techniques.

    <br>
    <b>  Text & Voice </b>
      I was responsible for integrating text throughout the piece. Inspired by artists like Young Hae-Chang Heavy Industries, I wanted to create impactful typographic experiences that could be loud without the accompaniment of sound.
      [oakflat3.gif]

      <br>
      <b>River, Personified</b></br>
I wrote the poem from the point of view of the Arizona Tonto Basin River— a body of water which would effectively be poisoned by the construction of the copper mine.
Some pieces of the writing were generalized to be more poetic about water in general. 
      [oakflat.gif] 
I wanted to be mindful of existing practices of nature personification without overstepping, especially because our team was comprised of non-local, non-indigenous artists.

  "content":`
  How much does the internet weigh? How much data do we consume?<br>Are their landfills of information on the internet?
[intro_bytes_reduced.jpg]

  The Byte Catalog expresses the degree to which text in digital space is now so immense in scale, that our bodies fail to comprehend it. Language originally comes from the human body, and holds meaning within social, relational contexts. What happens at scale—when language transcends meaning, when data transcends body? 
  This work began as a inquiry into the textual internet; over a semester, it evolved into a visceral experience of virtuality, including sculpture, video, and writing.

  <br><br>
  <b>1. VOLUME, WEIGHT</b>

  If our informational input could be measured in pounds, imagine how it would feel to literally consume or hold that much weight.

  In early explorations, I translated data into sculptural objects with mass to expand the abstract idea of "gigabyte" or "terabyte," into a sensory one.

  [dp_1.jpg]
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>2. CONVERSION TOOLS</b>
  The human body understands the material world and has unique intuitions that help us navigate it. I was interested in how people would use intuition to convert their understanding of virtual units into physical objects.
 I created interpretive “conversion tools” n the form of frames and boxes. Ech of these symbolized a space for an assigned virtual unit where people’s responses/objects would live.
  [crowdsourced.jpg]


  <br>
  <br>
  <b>3. WRITING</b>
  Writing was an important part of my process and discovery. I generated about 1MB worth of text and images throughout this project.       I populated that data into a <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzXTWcuY86iYcHFTREVrbVhrRzA/view?usp=sharing
' target='_blank'>process document</a> and a video (below).
  In the Byte Catalogue, I documented objects I crowd-sourced. I compared these against virtual experiences—for example, the Lord of the Rings trilogy in bytes.
  [dp_2.jpg]

  <br>
  <br>
  <b>4. OWNERSHIP OF VIRTUAL THINGS</b>
  Inspired by the Million Dollar website,  I was amused at the skeuomorph of buying “space” on the Internet.
  [7_alt.jpg]
  <br>
  I allocated pixel acre-age on my site for people to own, with a corresponding deed modeled after traditional land deeds.
  [dp_3.jpg]


  <br>
  <br>
  <b>5. VIRTUAL WORLD</b>
  Eventually I collected enough to fill up a room with artifacts. I found textual objects and materials of different weights and densities and quantified them in bytes.
  The piece also featured sculptural metaphors like downloading across glass jars, as well as plastic physical hard-drives.

    I wrote a poem about word sounds using <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" target = "_blank">CMU's pronouncing dictionary</a>.
    There’s such a material quality to spoken word—which are just meaty vibrations, with different ways of stopping air.
    My 1-month bare bones knowledge of linguistics tells me that air stopped with my lips, versus with teeth, versus tongue, are the most low-level differentiators between sounds that are innately “aggressive,” or innately “soft.”

    [babycastles1.jpg]
    For me, the exciting computational aspect was glomming together intense similarities in record time— creating this hyper-active form of English that almost evolved into something more abstractly shaped, like music.
    [0-realpython.jpg]
    “Rain in spain,” was the only string that has some intentional cultural reference. Originally from “My Fair Lady,” it acts as a kind of shibboleth for lower-class dialects; there’s a whole song about her conforming her vowel dipthongs.

  Collaboration with biologist Marian Shaw as part of NYU ITP's Biodesign studio.<br>I contributed to the research, concept, storytelling, and writing.
  Selected as a finalist for the <a href="https://biodesignchallenge.org/" target="_blank">Biodesign Challenge</a>, and presented at MoMA in 2018. 

  [overview_crop.jpg]

  As part of the man-made climate crisis, oceans are warmer and more acidic. Jellyfish, known as pulmōnēs in Latin, are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=21&v=uh4eImPI-OY&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=HarvardUniversity" target="_blank">overpopulating</a> parts of global oceans.
  Proliferating in blooms, they <a href="www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/05/01/workers-fishermen-scramble-to-fend-off-jellyfish-bloom-in-waters-off-east-java-power-plant.html" target="_blank">pose a threat</a> to human infrastructures, but more importantly, to biodiversity in the marine ecosystem. 
  
  [jelly-context.jpg]<span style="font-size:11px">Image copyright: Monty Graham, Dauphin Island Sea Lab // Getty Images</span>

  When plastic enters the oceans, marine wildlife often confuse it for their jellyfish prey and subsequently die from plastic consumption.
    [jelly21.jpg]<span style="font-size:11px">Image credit: Troy Mayne, World Wildlife Foundation.</span>

    What if we could close the loop between our jellyfish ‘problem’ and another marine threat— <b>petroleum-based plastic waste</b>? 

  [jelly3.jpeg]
  Jellyfish protein is almost exclusively <b>the structural protein collagen.</b> Given this 500-million year old creature consists of collagen of an earlier template in the evolutionary cycle, it has the potential to be a more universal biomaterial for various applications.
  We propose the use of <b>jellyfish gelatin</b> (which can be obtained by heating jellyfish collagen), <b>vegetable glycerin,</b> and <b>chitosan</b> to create food-safe, <a href="https://fabtextiles.org/the-secrets-of-bioplastic/" target="_blank">biodegradable plastics</a> which enter safely back into the ecosystem

  [jelly9.jpeg]

  <br>
  <br>
  <b>OUR PROCESS</b>
  We tested different ratios of glycerin to gelatin and plastic shape and size, creating samples with varying material properties that could lend themselves to different objects.
  
  [jelly5.jpeg]

  Crunchy like a disposable beverage bottle...
  [jelly6.jpeg]
  ...or supple yet strong like a ‘plastic’ bag.
  [jelly7.jpeg]

  In our final samples, we dyed plastics with beet juice and incorporated pigments produced by bacteria engineered to express colorful proteins derived from marine animals. 
  [jelly18.jpeg]



  <br>
  <br>
  <b>FINAL THOUGHTS</b>
  Despite the current abundance of jellyfish, do we have the right to steal them — even dead ones — from nature for our material desires?
  [pulmo_samples.jpg]
  We recognize that creating new biomaterials is not a substitute for urgent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal" target="_blank">policy</a> towards real environmental justice. Nor do we want to encourage future cycles of exploitation of abundance in order to deplete it.
  Our hope with this work is to illustrate effects of unsustainable supply chains on the ocean today — and to ask the audience to imagine how materials we use in the future can be more interoperable with our biological planet.

  Designed & built in collaboration with Anthony Bui, Asha Veeraswamy, and Keerthana Pareedy. I contributed conceptual work, front end dev, and graphics.
<br><b>THE STORY</b>
  Search Divides Us is an interactive exhibit about bias in search engines, through the example of a housing search. Our team demoed this at ITP Spring Show, as well as <a href="https://makerfaire.com/maker/entry/67996/" target="_blank">New York Maker Faire</a> in 2019.
  [plaque-2.jpg]
<br>
  <b>HARDWARE INTERFACE</b>
  The final interface followed a slot machine metaphor. The interface consisted of a set of dials: CLASS, RACE, EDUCATION. In the center, a green space-bar-shaped button would allow you to search.
  [video-1.gif]

<br><b>WEBSITE</b>
  I created a fictional island (modeled roughly after Manhattan, NY) and built fictional housing provider website. 
  [searchdivides_mini.gif]
  The result was projected onto a dark wall. We wanted the experience of entering in your demographic and receiving your result to be as public as possible, so that visitors would  think about these issues in dialogue with us and each other.
 
  [demo.jpg]
<br><b>RANDOM SEARCH</b>
  We encouraged visitors to explore how other search profiles tended towards different results. Using a "slot machine" metaphor, visitors could choose a new identity at random.
  [video-2-mini.gif]


  <br><b>PROCESS</b>
  Our team was inspired by the <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/august/nyu-study-looks-at-how-racial-inequality-is-produced-online.html" target = "_blank">research</a> of Dr. Charles McIlwain of NYU, which explores how the internet is as segregated as a city.

  Here’s our early design for a plinko machine, where the flippers represent categorization and algorithm bias.

      And vice versa: "art-making activities" can become meditations. Your art-making might center body and time in mechanical, transient ways. Think Richard Long's walks, or Goldsworthy-style <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5BixoGlVbwBOuRbQPQz76Gmg1e4b9uOwN5NW40/" target="_blank">leaves</a>.

//   <b>WHAT'S SCRATCH? </b>  
//   <a href="scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is an open-source programming language, creative tool, and online community used by millions of young people and educators around the world today.
//   For many children, Scratch is their first experience in computational media and virtual community. 

// <br>
//   <b>WHY THIS WORK? </b>  

//   Our previous join experience was text-heavy, less paced, and more utilitarian.
//   [join 6.png]

//   Scratch usage has been growing worldwide over the last few years. Often kids will be creating a new account as part of their classroom experience, or sometimes they will discover Scratch on their own. 
//   It felt crucial that we improve this first touch point – to emphasize a welcoming community, as well as the joy of building your first creative identity online.

// <br>
//   <b>NEW EXPERIENCE</b>
//   I remember my first foray with internet communities over a decade ago, and how emotional that could be.
//   We also recognize that we have a responsibility to onboard young people into internet community literacy — how to represent yourself online, while protecting your privacy.

//   <a href="scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is an open-source programming language, creative tool, and online community used by millions of young people and educators around the world today.
//    For many children, Scratch is their first experience in computational media and virtual community. 

//  <br>
//    <b>WHY THIS WORK?</b>  
//   Kids use the paint editor in Scratch to create stories, animations, games, and more. For many of them, Scratch is their first and only image editing software.
//   Through the Scratch online community, young people share creations about themselves and their communities. 
//   [community2.gif]
//   I wanted to lead this project because feel strongly about media representation generally; as a designer of creative tools, I'm especially passionate about our responsibilities to youth and their personal, expressive experiences. 
  
// <br>
//   <b>OUR EXISTING ARTWORK</b>
//   Our team responded to how the existing characters in our asset library were sometimes difficult to reshape, or recolor. Here's an example project by a young person in the community, who has created their own work-arounds:
//   [abby.gif]

//   We identified two main challenges:
//   <b>1. RECOLORING.</b>
//    Many of our existing assets, especially the bitmap characters, were difficult to recolor. For example, the hair contains multiple tones on this sprite.
//   [hannah.gif]
//   <b>2. RESHAPING.</b>
//    Even for our vector assets, reposing characters were challenging because they were not designed with editability. For example, the outline and fill are constructed separately on this ballerina.
//   [difficulty2.gif]
//    This artwork was launched as part of a 3-month project I led and managed, with a focus on helping kids represent themselves in artwork. 
//   It was important to us that beginners — new to Scratch, new to image editing, or both — could quickly see themselves in the tool and community.

// <br>
//   <b>NEW ARTWORK </b>
//   As part of this project, we launched four new character sets for the Scratch Asset Library. You can see them all at <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor" target ="_blank">scratch.mit.edu</a> in the sprite library.
//   Our team wanted to provide enough specificity through different options, as well as use simple shapes that could be easily altered and generalized.

//     [sprite2.png]

//   I drew this set of new vector characters. Now that they are in the Scratch Library, anyone can use them for their creative projects.

//   [sprite1-alt.png]

//   These character sets were built and grouped so they can be easily recolored or puppeted. Limb shapes are separated to move at the joint.
//   [sprite5.png]
//   [sprite3.gif]
 
//   Complex shapes like hair are left as groups of simple shapes — a strategy inspired by artists in the Scratch community.

//   Not only is it easier to modify, but also this offers an affordance on how vector illustrations are made.  

//   [sprite4.png]
//   [sprite4.gif]

//   Here's some examples of the new sprites in use in the community:

   A game I created with my team in under 24 hours at Hack@Brown 2015. I brought design chops to a team of two developers. We wanted to make group gaming more fun & inclusive, by using a controller most people already have in their pockets.
   In MoteMote, you use your smartphone as a remote and play as a teensy Mote character. Anyone can join at any point in the game. The project won <a href='http://hackatbrown2015.devpost.com/' target='blank' style='font-weight:bold'>Best Overall at Hack@Brown 2015</a>.

   Gameplay is like Mario Party Bumper Balls, except with shark danger and (in theory) infinite players.

		Bumble is a <b>collaborative fiction-building tool.</b> Users can create stories with their thumbs, and navigate a web of stories like a dungeon map. I collaborated with Kevin Cadena and Jamar Bromley in the studio course, Computer Utopias.
		[thumb2.jpg]
		<br><br>
		<b>What is the shape of mobile media?</b>
		Today, even with responsive design, much of mobile media retrofits desktop sites to a small screen. Scrollable content is not comfortable or “native” to this device.
		Our team was inspired by Hypercard and SmallTalk, which informed the shape of media-making on personal computers in the 1960s and beyond.
		[2.jpg]
		Our early sketches explored hyperlinkable, inspectable cards, where people could create webcontent without touching a full-size computer.
		The most difficult question was nailing down <b>what media our tool would enable.</b> Ephemeral, or invested? Individual, or collaborative?
		<br><br>
		<b>VERSION 1</b>
		Mobile devices encourage creative manipulation of images and videos. We were drawn to playful media, and inspired by Snapchat and Kidpix. In this iteration of Bumble, users could build <b>expressive webcards on a social network.</b>
		[4.jpg]
		The program was feature-loaded: color, text, audio, shape, stickers, and hyperlinks! But what are they making, and would they care?</b>
		<b>What we learned:</b> The timeframe for mobile content creation, in this case, was less invested than on desktop. We needed to serve this platform's attention span.
		<br><br>
		<b>VERSION 2</b>
		We challenged our initial assumption that people would want to craft handheld websites with care. We trashed all content primitives except video and scribbling.
		[6.jpg]
		Oops… so we made Snapchat’s less cool cousin. We lost our initial mission, which was to redefine what it meant to make and move in a mobile web browser.
		<b>What we learned:</b> It's better to make something that 100 people love than something for the masses to ignore. Make a monopoly, not more competition.
		<br><br>
		<b>VERSION 3: Storytelling redefines our vision.</b>
		Up until this point, we struggled to articulate who would use this, and why the phone matters. Full-blown websites were too heavy-duty for mobile, and Snapchat had already been done.

		In our final iteration, we created a storytelling platform fueled by <b>LARP culture</b>.
		The UI was inspired by <b>Choose-Your-Own Adventure,</b> and Borges' <b>Garden of the Forking Paths.</b>
		[7.jpg]
		The Bumble web is a four-directional architecture that respects the shape of your phone, and the singleness of a swipe. Users can see their website architecture from a birds-eye, dungeon-map view.

		<br>
		{<video src='work/bumble/demo.m4v' controls autoplay='on'></video>.}

		In our first version, Bumble serves a niche audience of <b>role-playing enthusiasts.</b> In the future, Bumble can grow to accommodate new content. Instructional threads could draw in new networks of crafty people demonstrating skills and recipes. Or, similar to Reddit, people from all over the world can respond to a single thread prompt, with infinite branches.

// 		I rebranded the James Turrell Museum in Bodega Colome, Argentina in 6 weeks for RISD's Brand Identity studio.
// 		I first wanted to know more about Turrell's work. What stood out to me was how he distills nature into this pure, temporal experience. His work focuses and frames natural processes—like the sunset— so the viewer enters this almost meditative state, where they are hyper-aware of passing time.
// 		Here's some early research: obsessive moodboarding, drawing, and word studies.
// 		[process4.jpg]
// 		[process1.jpg]
// 		<br><br>
// 		<b>LOGO CONCEPT</b>
// 		The final mark references a slow, recession of light, space, and atmosphere, while winking at the “T” of Turrell. The palette is a saturated take on the gradation of daylight, and the colors of the Turrell’s native Arizona landscape.
// 		[turrell-02.svg]
// [stationary_crop.jpg]
// 		[turrell12.jpg]
// 		[poster.jpg]
// 		<br>
// 		<b>PRINT MATERIALS</b>
// 		The way a Turrell piece transforms when viewed during different times of the day inspired these materials. The museum, open from 10:00AM to 6:00PM daily, issues a different colored ticket to visitors each hour. Viewed as a long strip, these tickets appear as a continuous gradient.
// 		[ticket.jpg]
// The event brochures together reference changing time throughout the year.
//         [books_all.jpg]
//         [book2.jpg]
// <br>
// 				<b>THE MUSEUM SPACE</b>
// What stood out to me about the museum's location was how beautiful the surrounding wineries were. This outdoor installation would bring visitors together in a tranquil museum garden. The pool connects to an unseen irrigation system which waters the nearby vines. In this way, the piece feeds back into the terrain, the way a Turrell piece works together with nature.
