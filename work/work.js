		"content":"I rebranded the James Turrell Museum in Bodega Colome, Argentina, as part of a 6-week assignment for RISD's Brand Identity studio. The process? First, 1-2 weeks of research, and 4 weeks of making. \nI first wanted to know more about Turrell's work. What stood out to me was how he distills nature into this pure, temporal experience. His work focuses and frames natural processes—like the sunset— so the viewer enters this almost meditative state, where they are hyper-aware of passing time.\n[process4.png]\nEarly moodboards.\n[process2.png]\nWordmapping & collecting brand inspiration.\n[process1.png]\nLogomark sketches. There are dozens more where this came from...\n[spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{LOGO & APPLICATION}</style>\nThe final mark references a slow, recession of light, space, and atmosphere, while winking at the “T” of Turrell. The palette is a saturated take on the gradation of daylight, and the colors of the Turrell’s native Arizona landscape.

The museum, open from 10:00AM to 6:00PM daily, issues a different colored ticket to visitors each hour. Viewed as a long strip, the tickets appear as a continuous gradient. \n[tickets-03.png]\nWhat stood out to me about the museum's location was how beautiful the surrounding wineries were. This outdoor installation would bring visitors together in a tranquil museum garden to relax. The pool connects to an unseen irrigation system which waters the grape vines on the trellises. In this way, the piece feeds back into the terrain, the way a Turrell piece works together with nature.\n[engagement.png]\n[spacer.png]"

The Museum remains pretty traditional today, so I started to think how younger visitors could explore its content through some newer technology. \nInstead of letting smartphones become a distraction in learning environments, we can make them a personalized lens for a young museum-goer, allowing kids to uncover a secret layer of fun facts at their own pace.\nWith MuseumScout, kids learn about extinction and conservation in a gotta-catch-'em-all game. Extinct species like the Dodo Bird and Passenger Pigeon are hidden throughout a virtual map of the museum. By panning over a marked area, they can see these critters come back to life through their cameras. \n[critters.gif]\n[pigeon.gif]\n[seacow.gif]\n[end.gif]\n [spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{Inspiration}</style>\n[inspo1.png]\n[inspo2.png]\n [spacer.png]\n<p style='font-weight:bold;text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:.5px;'>{Process}</style>\n[animals.gif]\n[user-flow-02.png]\n"
