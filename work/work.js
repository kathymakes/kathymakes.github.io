The idea came in response to our own frustrations as college students using E-Portfolio websites to learn and file-share. We observed that many of our peers also craved a more streamlined education experience online. \n We chose Google because many universities already rely on Gmail and Drive services. By utilizing apps the majority of internet users are already comfortable with, we save users the effort of committing to an unfamiliar system. \n[gb.png]\n[gb2.png]\n[gb3.png]\n[gb4.png]\n[gb5.png]\n[gb6.png]\n[gb7.png]\n[gb8.png]\n[gb9.png]\n[gb10.png]\n[gb11.png]\n"
