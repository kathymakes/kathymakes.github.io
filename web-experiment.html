Haha it’s about viral content  and cats  Haha good  hahah right??  explains so much about society.  Apparently kevin slavin is at Media lab!  can’t remember which branch  Ahhhh ok  Well first week of the semester’s down! Thesis project is beginning  How’re your classes  Ahhh! yes!

CONGRATS  where from?  Whoa! That’s intense dude  Btw I learned something random today that (kind of) relates haha  I was talking to someone about chinese counterfeit products  cause my people are super good at that hoho  and apparently counterfeit electronics is a thing??  and NASA, the US Navy, and US army have accidentally found themselves using “illegit” devices  SATURDAY ----------------  Yeah it’s so odd to think of something that functions just fine as “fake”  In some cases there’s not much quality distinction….  ahhh that whole industry is super interesting  like there are entire factories devoted to making counterfeit things  at that point it’s really weird to call it fake haha  anyway  I found a video of the project finally xD  but the sound is so muddled you can’t really tell what’s going on  Here’s a pic!  when a participant in boston puts their hand on the interface, jazz music plays  (the “treble” component of the duet)  when a participant in cambridge puts their hand down, drums play  so when both people have their hands on the table, smooth romantic jazz+drums fills the room haha  really? That’s crazy haha  Any examples?  Haha true  Haha  Apple fan boy?  hmmmm I’ve never been in a samsung store  I can see what you’re getting at though!  Haha  Ahhh I have to tell ya more about the computer Utopias class I’m in sometime  It’s crazy!  Yesterday we “took apart an iphone”  By listing all stuff it’s made of  Ooooh haha the apple store looks a little bluer than usual  That and Microsoft are both super similar in their approach  Though their feel is still pretty diff  Haha  It needs more helvetica  Also I think it has geniuses too  Yeah!! Old Verizon stores  And the little stands at costcos  True haha  Costco 4ever  Because the costco was right next to willy and my piano lessons place  We went there every single Sunday  Pretty much religiously  I think the food court prices have only inflated slightly  In the cents range haha  “The only constant is change”  “And also costco wholesales everywhere”  Hahaha  Omg  Oooh I never finished telling you about the AI thing  The solution to evil AI  I hope it’s not anticlimactic now  Basically— 1) AI get their own body that they’re tethered to and become “mortal” and also attached to some object instead of whizzing around in infinite networks  And also 2) alternately, they don’t interface with our physical world at all and live in a simulation that we can use to solve and predict problems  Yeah  It’s why I put it in quotes haha xD  That’s crazy!  Hmmm  When would you qualify something as real AI  Haha yes  Cats especially  Those devious creatures  Heh I always wanted one  Maybe i would have gotten the virus  Haha yes  Somehow  Ahh I should sleep now  Ahhh same  Alright thanks for geeking out with me haha  Goodnight!

Hustle time  February 25th, 1:53pm  hi sheffy  Kathy Wu:  hey hey hey! 😃  How’ve you been  Random question— are you interested in digital transactions/currency at all  Kathy Wu:  in regards that  IDEO + Harvard innovation lab have a makeathon this weekend  that you can apply to  not sure if you’re interested 😊 I applied—if i get in it would be a cool way to meet entrepreneurs  Kathy Wu:  They’ll be looking at transaction systems and digital money systems (bit coin, block chain)  no deadline is tonight at midnight!  I’ll send you the link if you’re interested 😊 no worries if you’re busy  Kathy Wu:  it’s a pretty hefty time commitment… Friday night to sunday  “Join IDEO’s Future Lab as interns at the Harvard i-lab for a paid summer internship exploring trust in transactions, micropayments, blockchain, bitcoin, and the future of participation platforms. Participants will be placed on teams, learn skills from venture designers, and access emerging technology experts. Student ventures may become part of IDEO’s Start-Up In Residence Program or be funded by corporate sponsors. We want students with a mix of backgrounds. No prior experience required.”  https://i-lab.harvard.edu/experiential-learning/make-a-thon-weekend-registration  (it’s actually an internship program, but the makeathon application is part of it?)  Kathy Wu:  there was an email from the GD dept saying it was extended till midnight for RISD students!  Kathy Wu:  Yes yes  😊  “Please note: We ask that you participate in the Make-a-Thon weekend only if you are willing and able to commit to the summer internship program.” It seems pretty tied to the internship program, so I think it’s worth doing if that’s something you’re interested in too!  Kathy Wu:  heh same… I kind of just jumped in  Kathy Wu:  ✌️fingers crossed!  We should also talk about our thing sometime :) First e’ship meeting is Monday  I feel like we should start sketching stuff  Kathy Wu:  Ahhh  I’m usually free Thursday mornings but not tomorrow  Weekend?  Kathy Wu:  Ah I’m not sure! Hopefully tomorrow  Kathy Wu:  ahhh yeah  are you hoping to do the internship? 😊  Kathy Wu:  Yeah totally😊  Ahh did you get an email from them?  (Ps it’s really awesome you’re into investing! You have to share some of your know how with me sometime)  Kathy Wu:  Yeeeesssss  Kathy Wu:  I know ah  Kathy Wu:  I’m clueless though  I gotta do my HW first  Kathy Wu:  Yeah trueeee  Kathy Wu:  I know that’s a major concern  Kathy Wu:  Yeah I’d love to hear :)  Kathy Wu:  Haha agreed!

We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.”  If you can imagine  Nikola Tesla said this  in 1926  Hahahaha I love it  You beat the game  right???
