<p>Lars Løkke Rasmussen served as Interior and Health Minister between 2001 and 2007 until he was appointed Minister of Finance in 2007. He was responsible for negotiating a 2002 agreement between <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venstre_(Denmark)" title="Venstre (Denmark)">Venstre</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_People%27s_Party_(Denmark)" title="Conservative People's Party (Denmark)">Conservatives</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democrats_(Denmark)" title="Social Democrats (Denmark)">Social Democrats</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_People%27s_Party" title="Danish People's Party">Danish People's Party</a> giving patients in public hospitals the right to select a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_hospital" title="Private hospital">private hospital</a>, provided that the public hospital had been unable to treat the patient within two months. In 2007, this time limit was lowered to one month. Since 2002, the government has awarded extra funds earmarked at reducing the waiting list at National Health Service hospitals, a grant sometimes referred to by the media as <i>Løkkeposen</i> (A pun on 'lykkepose' the Danish word for a goodie bag). He also represented the government during negotiations regarding a reform of the system by which richer municipalities transfer part of their tax incomes to poorer municipalities.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2008, Lars Løkke Rasmussen was accused by the media of having charged his official accounts with considerable expenses (ca. 800.000 Danish Kroner) he should have paid himself, e.g. restaurants, cigarettes, taxis, and hotels, both as county mayor and as minister. In May 2007, Løkke was accused of having his ministry pay for a hotel room in Copenhagen when he privately attended a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> concert in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsens" title="Horsens">Horsens</a> in 2004.</p>

<p>After then Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen won his second reelection in 2007 he created his third cabinet in which Løkke Rasmussen was appointed Minister of Finance. This was seen as a clear indicator that Løkke was next in line to follow Fogh as leader of Venstre and Prime Minister, when Fogh would leave Danish politics.

<p>In February 2009, Lars Løkke Rasmussen was the chief negotiator in the political agreement behind a major tax reform, implementing the government's ambition of reducing income tax and increasing taxes on pollution. The reform was, according to Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the biggest reduction of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_tax_rate" title="Marginal tax rate" class="mw-redirect">marginal tax rate</a> since the introduction of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income tax</a> in 1903. The opposition accused it of being historically skewed in favouring those with high-income jobs and giving very little to those with low-income jobs.</p>

<p>On 4 April 2009, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a> decided that prime minister <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen" title="Anders Fogh Rasmussen">Anders Fogh Rasmussen</a> would replace <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaap_de_Hoop_Scheffer" title="Jaap de Hoop Scheffer">Jaap de Hoop Scheffer</a> as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO" title="Secretary General of NATO">Secretary General of NATO</a>. On the same day, Anders Fogh Rasmussen declared that he would resign as prime minister on 5 April 2009. As deputy of the largest party in the government, Lars Løkke Rasmussen thus took over the post as prime minister of Denmark. An opinion poll released on the day of Lars Løkke Rasmussen's takeover of the post as prime minister revealed that the Danes believe that he only beats <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helle_Thorning-Schmidt" title="Helle Thorning-Schmidt">Helle Thorning-Schmidt</a> as the person best suited for bringing Denmark through the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_crisis_of_2008%E2%80%932009" title="Global financial crisis of 2008–2009" class="mw-redirect">financial crisis</a>, and that Thorning-Schmidt would be better suited to combatting unemployment, reducing hospital waiting lists, securing the welfare society of the future, and representing Denmark internationally. On 7 April 2009, Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced the new set of ministers in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Lars_L%C3%B8kke_Rasmussen" title="Cabinet of Lars Løkke Rasmussen">his Cabinet</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="COP15_-_December_2009">COP15 - December 2009</span><a target="_blank" href="#editor/11" data-section="11" class="edit-page">Edit</a></h3>
<p>Lars Løkke Rasmussen has been sharply criticized from many sides for his handling of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference_2009" title="United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009" class="mw-redirect">COP15</a> leadership.</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the summit high level section, led by Lars Løkke Rasmussen, a number of countries protested the Danish handling of the negotiations. ”We cannot continue to talk about procedure, procedure, procedure. We must move forward. The World awaits us”, said Lars Løkke Rasmussen responding to criticism of the Danish led negotiations coming from several countries who regarded them as undemocratic.</p>
<p>Many developing countries viewed this statement as arrogant. Procedure is a major element in UN negotiations. ”This is not about procedure. This is about content. We have stated that the results in Copenhagen must come in two texts. One cannot simply present a text pulled from the clouds”, replied the Chinese delegate in the auditorium.</p>
<p>Stanislaus Lumumba Di-Aping, chief negotiator for the Developing Nations' organisation <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_77" title="Group of 77">G77</a>, cross examined what exactly Løkke Rasmussen meant when stating that the chairmen of the negotiating groups should be "people whom we trust". Criticism of the Office of the Prime Minister was supported by China, India and Brazil. The last had been regarded as an ally by the Danish delegation.</p>
<p>The international press, too, has been severe in its criticism of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office.

<p><b>Homosexual behavior in animals</b> is sexual behavior among non-human species that may be interpreted as homosexual or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a>. This may include <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behaviour" title="Animal sexual behaviour">sexual activity</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship" title="Courtship">courtship</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection" title="Affection">affection</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_bond" title="Pair bond">pair bonding</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting" title="Parenting">parenting</a> among same-sex animal pairs. Research indicates that various forms of this are found throughout the animal kingdom. As of 1999, nearly 1,500 species, ranging from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primates" title="Primates" class="mw-redirect">primates</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthocephala" title="Acanthocephala">gut worms</a>, have been observed engaging in same-sex behaviors; this is well documented in about 500 species.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bagemihl" title="Bruce Bagemihl">Bruce Bagemihl</a>, "the animal kingdom [does] it with much greater sexual diversity&nbsp;– including homosexual, bisexual and nonreproductive sex&nbsp;– than the scientific community and society at large have previously been willing to accept." Nevertheless, Bagemihl points out, this is "necessarily an account of human interpretations of these phenomena". <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_LeVay" title="Simon LeVay">Simon Levay</a> introduced the further caveat that "Although homosexual behavior is very common in the animal world, it seems to be very uncommon that individual animals have a long-lasting predisposition to engage in such behavior to the exclusion of heterosexual activities. Thus, a homosexual orientation, if one can speak of such thing in animals, seems to be a rarity." One species in which exclusive homosexual orientation occurs, however, is that of domesticated sheep (<i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovis_aries" title="Ovis aries" class="mw-redirect">Ovis aries</a></i>). "About 10% of rams (males) refuse to mate with ewes (females) but do readily mate with other rams."</p>
<p>The sexual behavior of non-human animals takes many different forms, even within the same <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, though homosexual behavior is best known from social species. The motivations for and implications of these behaviors have yet to be fully understood, since most species have yet to be fully studied.</p>
<p>The observation of homosexual behavior in animals can be seen as both an argument for and against the acceptance of homosexuality in humans, and has been used especially against the claim that it is a <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peccatum_contra_naturam" title="Peccatum contra naturam" class="mw-redirect">peccatum contra naturam</a></i> ('sin against nature'). For instance, homosexuality in animals was cited by the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association" title="American Psychiatric Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> and other groups in their <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amici_curiae" title="Amici curiae" class="mw-redirect">amici curiae</a> brief to the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court" title="United States Supreme Court" class="mw-redirect">United States Supreme Court</a> in <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas" title="Lawrence v.

Texas</a></i>, which ultimately struck down the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws" title="Sodomy laws" class="mw-redirect">sodomy laws</a> of 14 states.</p>

</div><div class="content_block" id="content_block_0" aria-pressed="false" aria-expanded="false">
<p>The term <i>homosexual</i> was coined by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Maria_Kertbeny" title="Karl-Maria Kertbeny">Karl-Maria Kertbeny</a> in 1868 to describe same-sex sexual attraction and sexual behavior in humans. Its use in animal studies has been controversial for two main reasons: animal sexuality and motivating factors have been and remain poorly understood, and the term has strong cultural implications in western society that are irrelevant for species other than <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="Human">humans</a>. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. When describing animals, the term <i>homosexual</i> is preferred over <i>gay</i>, <i>lesbian</i>, and other terms currently in use, as these are seen as even more bound to human homosexuality.</p>
<p>Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. In wild animals, researchers will as a rule not be able to map the entire life of an individual, and must infer from frequency of single observations of behavior. The correct usage of the term <i>homosexual</i> is that an animal <i>exhibits homosexual behavior</i> or even <i>same-sex sexual behavior</i>; however, this article conforms to the usage by modern research, applying the term <i>homosexuality</i> to all sexual behavior (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behavior" title="Animal sexual behavior" class="mw-redirect">copulation</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genital_stimulation" title="Genital stimulation" class="mw-redirect">genital stimulation</a>, mating games and sexual <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_(zoology)" title="Display (zoology)">display behavior</a>) between animals of the same sex. In most instances, it is presumed that the homosexual behavior is but part of the animal's overall sexual behavioral repertoire, making the animal "bisexual" rather than "homosexual" as the terms are commonly understood in humans, but cases of homosexual preference and exclusive homosexual pairs are known.</p>
</div><div class="content_block" id="content_block_1" aria-pressed="false" aria-expanded="false">
<p>A majority of the research available concerning homosexual behavior in animals lacks specification between animals that exclusively exhibit same-sex tendencies and those that participate in heterosexual and homosexual mating activities interchangeably. This lack of distinction has led to differing opinions and conflicting interpretations of collected data amongst scientists and researchers. For instance, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bagemihl" title="Bruce Bagemihl">Bruce Bagemihl</a>, author of the book <i>Biological Exuberence: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity</i>, emphasizes that there is no anatomical or endocrinological differences between exclusively homosexual and exclusively heterosexual animal pairs. However, if the definition of "homosexual behavior" is made to include animals that participate in both same-sex and opposite-sex mating activities, hormonal differences have been documented among key <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormones" title="Sex hormones" class="mw-redirect">sex hormones</a>, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol" title="Estradiol">estradiol</a>, when compared to those who participate solely in heterosexual mating.</p>
<p>Many of the animals used in laboratory-based studies of homosexuality do not appear to spontaneously exhibit these tendencies often in the wild. Such behavior is often elicited and exaggerated by the researcher during experimentation through the destruction of a portion of brain tissue, or by exposing the animal to high levels of steroid hormones prenatally. Information gathered from these studies is limited when applied to spontaneously occurring same-sex behavior in animals outside of the laboratory.</p>
<p>The presence of same-sex sexual behavior was not 'officially' observed on a large scale until recent times, possibly due to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect" title="Observer-expectancy effect">observer bias</a> caused by social attitudes to same-sex sexual behavior, innocent confusion, or even from a fear of "being ridiculed by their colleagues." Georgetown University <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologist" title="Biologist">biologist</a> Janet Mann states "Scientists who study the topic are often accused of trying to forward an agenda, and their work can come under greater scrutiny than that of their colleagues who study other topics." They also noted "Not every sexual act has a reproductive function ... that's true of humans and non-humans." It appears to be widespread amongst social <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, particularly the sea mammals and the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primates" title="Primates" class="mw-redirect">primates</a>. The true extent of homosexuality in animals is not known. While studies have demonstrated homosexual behavior in a number of species, Petter Bøckman, the scientific advisor of the exhibition <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Nature%3F" title="Against Nature?">Against Nature?</a> in 2007, speculated that the true extent of the phenomenon may be much larger than was then recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No species has been found in which homosexual behaviour has <i>not</i> been shown to exist, with the exception of species that never have sex at all, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin" title="Sea urchin">sea urchins</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphis" title="Aphis">aphis</a>. Moreover, a part of the animal kingdom is <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite" title="Hermaphrodite">hermaphroditic</a>, truly bisexual. For them, homosexuality is not an issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of overlooking homosexual behavior is noted by Bagemihl describing mating giraffes where nine out of ten pairings occur between males.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every male that sniffed a female was reported as sex, while anal intercourse with orgasm between males was only "revolving around" <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_and_submission" title="Dominance and submission">dominance</a>, competition or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting" title="Greeting">greetings</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some researchers believe this behavior to have its origin in male social organization and social dominance, similar to the dominance traits shown in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_sexuality" title="Prison sexuality">prison sexuality</a>. Others, particularly Bagemihl, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Roughgarden" title="Joan Roughgarden">Joan Roughgarden</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Lod%C3%A9" title="Thierry Lodé">Thierry Lodé</a> and Paul Vasey suggest the social function of sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) is not necessarily connected to dominance, but serves to strengthen alliances and social ties within a flock. Others have argued that social organization theory is inadequate because it cannot account for some homosexual behaviors, for example, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin" title="Penguin">penguin</a> species where same-sex individuals mate for life and refuse to pair with females when given the chance. While reports on many such mating scenarios are still only anecdotal, a growing body of scientific work confirms that permanent homosexuality occurs not only in species with permanent pair bonds, but also in non-monogamous species like sheep.</p>
<p>One report on sheep cited below states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately 8% of rams exhibit sexual preferences [that is, even when given a choice] for male partners (male-oriented rams) in contrast to most rams, which prefer female partners (female-oriented rams). We identified a cell group within the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus of age-matched adult sheep that was significantly larger in adult rams than in ewes...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, apparent homosexual individuals are known from all of the traditional domestic species, from sheep, cattle and horses to cats, dogs and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigars" title="Budgerigars" class="mw-redirect">budgerigars</a>.</p>
</div><div class="content_block" id="content_block_2" aria-pressed="false" aria-expanded="false">
<p>A definite <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiological" title="Physiological" class="mw-redirect">physiological</a> explanation or reason for homosexual activity in animal species has not been agreed upon by researchers in the field. Numerous scholars are of the opinion that varying levels (either higher or lower) of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormones" title="Sex hormones" class="mw-redirect">sex hormones</a> in the animal, in addition to the size of the animal's gonads, play a direct role in the sexual behavior and preference exhibited by that animal. Others firmly argue no evidence to support these claims exists when comparing animals of a specific species exhibiting homosexual behavior exclusively and those that don't. Ultimately, empirical support from comprehensive <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinological" title="Endocrinological" class="mw-redirect">endocrinological</a> studies exist for both interpretations. Researchers found no evidence of differences in the measurements of the gonads, or the levels of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormones" title="Sex hormones" class="mw-redirect">sex hormones</a> of exclusively homosexual <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_gulls" title="Western gulls" class="mw-redirect">western gulls</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-billed_gulls" title="Ring-billed gulls" class="mw-redirect">ring-billed gulls</a>. However, when analyzing these differences in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexual" title="Bisexual" class="mw-redirect">bisexual</a> rams, males were found to have lower levels of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol" title="Estradiol">estradiol</a> in their blood, as well as smaller gonads than their <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexual" title="Heterosexual" class="mw-redirect">heterosexual</a> counterpart.</p>
<p>Additional studies pertaining to hormone involvement in homosexual behavior indicate that when administering treatments of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol" title="Estradiol">estradiol</a> to female heterosexual animals, the elevated hormone levels increase the likelihood of homosexual behavior. Additionally, boosting the levels of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormones" title="Sex hormones" class="mw-redirect">sex hormones</a> during an animal's pregnancy appears to increase the likelihood of it birthing a homosexual offspring.</p>

<p>Researchers found that disabling the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/945842.html">fucose mutarotase</a> (FucM) gene in laboratory mice – which influences the levels of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen" title="Estrogen">estrogen</a> to which the brain is exposed – caused the female mice to behave as if they were male as they grew up.

<p>An estimated one-quarter of all <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swans" title="Black swans" class="mw-redirect">black swans</a> pairings are of homosexual males. They steal nests, or form temporary threesomes with females to obtain eggs, driving away the female after she lays the eggs. More of their <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan" title="Swan">cygnets</a> survive to adulthood than those of different-sex pairs, possibly due to their superior ability to defend large portions of land. The same reasoning has been applied to male <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamingo" title="Flamingo">flamingo</a> pairs raising chicks.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gulls">Gulls</span></h4>

The two male vultures raised the chick together. A few years later, however, Yehuda became interested in a female vulture that was brought into the aviary.

Roughly 60% of all bonobo sexual activity occurs between two or more females. While the homosexual bonding system in Bonobos represents the highest frequency of homosexuality known in any species, homosexuality has been reported for all <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_apes" title="Great apes" class="mw-redirect">great apes</a> (a group which includes <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="Human">humans</a>), as well as a number of other <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate" title="Primate">primate</a> species.</p>

Anything that arouses the interest of more than one bonobo at a time, not just food, tends to result in sexual contact. If two bonobos approach a cardboard box thrown into their enclosure, they will briefly mount each other before playing with the box. Such situations lead to squabbles in most other species. But bonobos are quite tolerant, perhaps because they use sex to divert attention and to defuse tension.</p>
<p>Bonobo sex often occurs in aggressive contexts totally unrelated to food. A jealous male might chase another away from a female, after which the two males reunite and engage in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum" title="Scrotum">scrotal</a> rubbing. Or after a female hits a juvenile, the latter's mother may lunge at the aggressor, an action that is immediately followed by genital rubbing between the two adults.</p>

<p>Dolphins of several species engage in homosexual acts, though it is best studied in the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottlenose_dolphin" title="Bottlenose dolphin">bottlenose dolphins</a>. Sexual encounters between females take the shape of "beak-genital propulsion", where one female inserts her beak in the genital opening of the other while swimming gently forward. Between males, homosexual behaviour includes rubbing of genitals against each other, which sometimes leads to the males swimming belly to belly, inserting <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_penis" title="Dolphin penis" class="mw-redirect">the penis</a> in the others <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genital_slit" title="Genital slit" class="mw-redirect">genital slit</a> and sometimes anus.</p>

She cites studies showing that these dolphins later in life as adults are in a sense bisexual, and the male bonds forged earlier in life work together for protection as well as locating females to reproduce with. Confrontations between flocks of bottlenose dolphins and the related species <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_spotted_dolphin" title="Atlantic spotted dolphin">Atlantic spotted dolphin</a> will sometimes lead to cross-species homosexual behaviour between the males rather than combat.</p>

Such encounters are often associated with affectionate interactions, such as kissing, trunk intertwining, and placing trunks in each other's mouths. Male elephants, who often live apart from the general herd, often form "companionships", consisting of an older individual and one or sometimes two younger, attendant males with sexual behavior being an important part of the social dynamic. Unlike <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexual" title="Heterosexual" class="mw-redirect">heterosexual</a> relations, which are always of a fleeting nature, the relationships between males may last for years. The encounters are analogous to heterosexual bouts, one male often extending his trunk along the other's back and pushing forward with his tusks to signify his intention to mount. Same-sex relations are common and frequent in both sexes, with Asiatic elephants in captivity devoting roughly 45% of sexual encounters to same-sex activity.</p>

<p><i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovis_aries" title="Ovis aries" class="mw-redirect">Ovis aries</a></i> has attracted much attention due to the fact that some rams seem to have an exclusive homosexual orientation.</p>
<p>An October 2003 study by Dr. Charles E. Roselli et al. (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Health_and_Science_University" title="Oregon Health and Science University" class="mw-redirect">Oregon Health and Science University</a>) states that homosexuality in male sheep (found in 8% of rams) is associated with a region in the rams' brains which the authors call the "ovine Sexually Dimorphic Nucleus" (oSDN) which is half the size of the corresponding region in heterosexual male sheep.</p>
<p>Scientists found that, "The oSDN in rams that preferred females was significantly larger and contained more <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons" title="Neurons" class="mw-redirect">neurons</a> than in male-oriented rams and ewes. In addition, the oSDN of the female-oriented rams expressed higher levels of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase" title="Aromatase">aromatase</a>, a substance that converts <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol" title="Estradiol">estradiol</a>, a form of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen" title="Estrogen">estrogen</a> which is believed to facilitate typical male sexual behaviors. Aromatase expression was no different between male-oriented rams and ewes."</p>
<p>"The dense cluster of neurons that comprise the oSDN express <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome" title="Cytochrome">cytochrome</a> P450 aromatase. Aromatase <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA" title="MRNA" class="mw-redirect">mRNA</a> levels in the oSDN were significantly greater in female-oriented rams than in ewes, whereas male-oriented rams exhibited intermediate levels of expression." These results suggest that "...naturally occurring variations in sexual partner preferences may be related to differences in brain anatomy and its capacity for estrogen synthesis." As noted before, given the potential unagressiveness of the male population in question, the differing aromatase levels may also have been evidence of aggression levels, not sexuality. It should also be noted that the results of this study have not been confirmed by other studies.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_Veterinary_Manual" title="Merck Veterinary Manual">Merck Manual of Veterinary Medicine</a> appears to consider homosexuality among sheep as a routine occurrence and an issue to be dealt with as a problem of animal husbandry.</p>

In <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedagogus" title="Paedagogus">Paedagogus</a></i>, Clement of Alexandria noted that the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena" title="Hyena">hyena</a> (along with the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hare</a>) was "quite obsessed with sexual intercourse." Many Europeans associated the hyena with sexual deformity, prostitution, deviant sexual behavior, and even witchcraft.</p>
<p>The reality behind the confusing reports is the sexually aggressive behavior between the females, including mounting between females. Research has shown that "in contrast to most other female mammals, female <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocuta" title="Crocuta" class="mw-redirect">Crocuta</a></i> are male-like in appearance, larger than males, and substantially more aggressive," and they have "been <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculine" title="Masculine" class="mw-redirect">masculinized</a> without being <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femininity" title="Femininity">defeminized</a>.”</p>
<p>Study of this unique <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitalia" title="Genitalia" class="mw-redirect">genitalia</a> and aggressive behavior in the female hyena has led to the understanding that more aggressive females are better able to compete for resources, including food and mating partners.

<p><i><b>Mockingjay</b></i> is a 2010 <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> novel by American author <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins" title="Suzanne Collins">Suzanne Collins</a>. It is the last installment of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_trilogy" title="The Hunger Games trilogy"><i>The Hunger Games</i></a>, following 2008's <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games" title="The Hunger Games">The Hunger Games</a></i> and 2009's <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire" title="Catching Fire">Catching Fire</a></i>. The book continues the story of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen" title="Katniss Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a>, who agrees to unify the districts of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Panem" title="The Hunger Games universe">Panem</a> in a rebellion against the tyrannical <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#The_Capitol" title="The Hunger Games universe">Capitol</a>. The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcover" title="Hardcover">hardcover</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook" title="Audiobook">audiobook</a> editions of <i>Mockingjay</i> were published by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation" title="Scholastic Corporation">Scholastic</a> on August 24, 2010, six days after the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebook" title="Ebook" class="mw-redirect">ebook</a> edition went on sale. The book sold 450,000 copies in the first week of release, exceeding the publisher's expectations. It received a generally positive reaction from critics.</p>
<p></p>
</div><div class="content_block openSection" id="content_block_0" aria-pressed="true" aria-expanded="true">
<p>Collins has said that the main inspiration for <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_trilogy" title="The Hunger Games trilogy"><i>The Hunger Games</i> trilogy</a> came from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur#Theseus_and_the_Minotaur" title="Minotaur">the classical account</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus" title="Theseus">Theseus</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur" title="Minotaur">Minotaur</a>. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos" title="Minos">Minos</a>'s son <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgeos" title="Androgeos">Androgeos</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> was forced to sacrifice <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrificial_victims_of_Minotaur" title="Sacrificial victims of Minotaur">seven youths and seven maidens</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete" title="Crete">Crete</a>, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided to put an end to the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.</p>
<p>Collins has said that there are also many parallels between the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> and the fictional nation of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Panem" title="The Hunger Games universe">Panem</a>. She describes the Hunger Games as "an updated version of the Roman gladiator games, which entails a ruthless government forcing people to fight to the death as popular entertainment." Collins also explains that the name "Panem" came from the Latin phrase "<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses" title="Bread and circuses">Panem et Circenses</a>", which means "Bread and Circuses" and refers to the strategy used by Roman emperors to appease the masses by providing them with food and entertainment.</p>
<p>As with the previous books in the trilogy, <i>Mockingjay</i> contains 27 chapters, with nine chapters in each of the three parts. This structure, which Collins had previously used in her series <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Underland_Chronicles" title="The Underland Chronicles">The Underland Chronicles</a></i>, came from Collins's playwriting background. This "three-act" structure is also apparent in the trilogy as a whole; Collins stated that she "knew from the beginning" that she was going to write a trilogy.</p>
<p>The cover and title information was revealed by Scholastic on February 11, 2010. The cover continues the previous books' theme on the symbol of peace. The novel's title comes from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Mockingjays" title="The Hunger Games universe">the hybrid birds</a> of the same name that feature in the novels' storyline. As <i>Publishers Weekly</i> has stated, "the hybrid birds that are an important symbol—of hope and rebellion—throughout the books". Collins likens Katniss to a Mockingjay because both "should never have existed".</p>

<p>Katniss Everdeen, her sister Prim, and her friends Finnick Odair and Gale Hawthorne all reluctantly adjust to a highly structured life in the underground District 13, which has been spearheading the rebellion in Panem. Katniss eventually agrees to act as "the Mockingjay"—a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_child" title="Poster child">poster child</a> for the rebellion—but only on the condition that District 13's President Alma Coin vows to grant immunity to all of the past Hunger Games tributes, including Katniss's friend Peeta Mellark and Finnick's lover Annie Cresta, and to reserve for Katniss the right to personally kill Panem's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Snow" title="President Snow" class="mw-redirect">President Snow</a> once he is captured. Tasked with starring in rebel propaganda films, called propos, Katniss is unhappily kept out of actual combat until she defiantly participates in a tragic battle involving the bombing of a hospital at District 8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Peeta is being held by the Capitol and forced to defame Katniss and the rebels on live television. During one broadcast, though, he exposes the Capitol's surprise plan to bomb District 13, thus saving many lives during the ensuing explosions but also causing the Capitol's torturers to "hijack" him, a process in which he is infused with <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Fauna_unique_to_Panem" title="The Hunger Games universe">tracker jacker</a> venom, developing in him a deranged resentment and fear of Katniss. Soon afterward, District 13 leads a successful mission to rescue Peeta and other tributes of the most recent Games, including Annie, but Peeta immediately attempts to kill Katniss upon their reunion. Therapy improves Peeta's psychological condition over time, but he retains some memory loss and is still prone to violent outbursts toward Katniss.</p>
<p>District 13 hosts Finnick and Annie's wedding, and a controversial strategy proposed by Gale wins a decisive victory at District 2, readying the rebels to launch a final campaign against the Capitol itself. Katniss and her propo team are deployed on a trivial assignment to the Capitol, joined by Peeta, who is unexpectedly sent with them by President Coin; Katniss interprets this to mean that Coin, anticipating the war's end, no longer requires or trusts Katniss and now expects her to be murdered by the unstable Peeta. While filming in a purportedly safe Capitol neighborhood, the team's commander, Boggs, is killed. Taking charge, Katniss convinces the others they are on a secret mission to assassinate President Snow. Consequently, during intense <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_warfare" title="Urban warfare">urban warfare</a> that involves Hunger Games-like monsters and ambushes, many of Katniss's teammates, including Finnick, are killed. Katniss presses on alone towards President Snow's mansion, which has been surrounded by Capitol refugee children being used as human shields to protect Snow. As Katniss reaches the mansion, a hoverplane with Capitol markings drops parachutes onto the children that explode. The rebels' <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_medic" title="Combat medic">combat medics</a>, including Katniss's sister Prim, move in to help the injured children, but further parachutes explode, severely burning Katniss and killing Prim.</p>
<p>During her recuperation, Katniss becomes deeply depressed over her sister's death. The rebels have won the war, and Katniss confronts President Snow, who, awaiting execution, claims that Coin orchestrated Prim's death. He reminds Katniss that they agreed not to lie to each other in the past, persuasively arguing that the hoverplane airstrike could have served him no purpose. Suddenly, Katniss realizes in horror that the hoverplane attack closely resembled Gale's bombing strategy at District 2. When Katniss confronts Gale about his possible involvement, however, he merely expresses uncertainty. Katniss's suspicions grow into a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>.</p>
<p>President Coin proposes an idea that leads to a majority of the surviving tributes, including Katniss (but not Peeta), voting in favor of punishing the Capitol just as the Capitol punished the Districts: by holding a final Hunger Games that will target the children of the Capitol's leaders. Before Coin can organize this event, though, the day of Snow's execution arrives, and Katniss is given the task of executing him. As she prepares to do so, Snow flashes her a smile and, making her decision, Katniss raises her bow and shoots Coin instead, killing her. Katniss immediately attempts suicide, but Peeta stops her, and she is arrested during the ensuing riot. After the riot, Snow is mysteriously found dead, Katniss is acquitted of Coin's murder by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_of_insanity" title="Reason of insanity" class="mw-redirect">reason of insanity</a>, and she is relocated to the ruins of her home, District 12. Months later, having largely recovered from his brainwashing, Peeta and some other District 12 natives also return there. Katniss embraces her love for Peeta, recognizing her need for his hope and strength, in contrast to Gale, who has the same fire she already finds in herself. Together, they write a book filled with the stories of previous tributes of the Hunger Games in order to preserve the memory of those who died.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, in the epilogue, Katniss and Peeta are married and now have two children. The Hunger Games are over for good, but Peeta still suffers trauma from his "hijacking," and Katniss dreads the day her children learn about their parents' involvement in both the Games and the war. When she feels distressed, Katniss plays a comforting but repetitive "game," reminding herself of every good thing she has ever seen someone do. The series ends with Katniss' somber reflection that "there are much worse games to play."</p>
</div><div class="content_block openSection" id="content_block_2" aria-pressed="true" aria-expanded="true">
<p>Reviews have noted many themes in the previous books that are also explored in "Mockingjay". A review from <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun" title="The Baltimore Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a></i> noted that "the themes of the series, including physical hardships, loyalty in extreme circumstances and traversing morally ambiguous terrain, are continued at an even larger scale." In the book, Katniss must deal with betrayal and violence against people. At the same time, while she was symbolically touching thousands of lives, she must also lead those people into war. Finally, Katniss realizes she cannot even trust <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Characters_in_the_Hunger_Games_trilogy#President_Alma_Coin" title="List of Characters in the Hunger Games trilogy" class="mw-redirect">President Coin</a>, leader of District 13.</p>
<p>In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the series "tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war." Collins replied that this inspiration was from her father, who, when going to war in Vietnam, made sure that his children understood the consequences and effects of war. Yvonne Zipp of <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Science_Monitor" title="The Christian Science Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a></i> noted that it was "the most brutal of the trilogy" and that "Collins doesn't take war lightly&nbsp;– her characters debate the morality involved in tactics used to try to overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those tactics." Katie Roiphe of <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> wrote that "it is the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world." In a review for <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i>, Bob Minzesheimer pointed out that the novel contained optimism: "Hope emerges from despair. Even in a dystopian future, there's a better future."</p>
<p>Minzesheimer also noted a central question of "Real or not real?" which was asked throughout the novel by Peeta. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Carpenter" title="Susan Carpenter">Susan Carpenter</a> of the <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> also pointed this out, writing, "<i>Mockingjay</i> takes readers into new territories and an even more brutal and confusing world: one where it's unclear what sides the characters are on, one where presumed loyalties are repeatedly stood on their head".</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Promotion">Promotion</span><a target="_blank" href="#editor/7" data-section="7" class="edit-page">Edit</a></h3>
<p>To promote the release of <i>Mockingjay</i>, many bookstores held midnight release parties. The official event in New York City was attended by Collins, and included many activities such as a tarot card reader, a magician, jugglers and face-painters. Prizes such as signed copies of <i>Catching Fire</i> and Hunger Games-themed cups were raffled. Once Collins arrived, she read the first chapter of the novel, explaining that she would read with an accent since Katniss, the narrator, is from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia" title="Appalachia">Appalachia</a>. By midnight, copies were being sold with a signature stamp since Collins had a hand injury and was unable to sign.</p>
<p>Before the release, Scholastic also released a trailer for the book, launched a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> page that gained over 22,000 fans in 10 days, and held a contest for booksellers to win a visit from Collins and an online countdown clock to the release date.

National Entertainment Collectibles Association also sold other goods such as t-shirts, posters, games and bracelets. Collins also held a "13-District Blog Tour" where 13 winners received a free copy of <i>Mockingjay</i> on August 24, 2010. A tour was also scheduled, starting at Books of Wonder in New York where the official party took place. The tour ended on November 6, 2010, in the Third Place Books store in Lake Forest Park, Washington.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span><a target="_blank" href="#editor/8" data-section="8" class="edit-page">Edit</a></h3>
<p><i>Mockingjay</i> has received generally positive reviews from critics. Some noted that there was a suspense drop between <i>Catching Fire</i> and the start of <i>Mockingjay</i>. Nicole Sperling of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> gave the book a B+ and said, "Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot". <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Weekly" title="Publishers Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a></i> gave the book a starred review, calling it "the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level". The review went on to praise the "sharp social commentary and the nifty world building". <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkus_Reviews" title="Kirkus Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a></i> gave <i>Mockingjay</i> a starred review, saying that the book is exactly what its fans are looking for and that "it will grab them and not let go". <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Carpenter" title="Susan Carpenter">Susan Carpenter</a> of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> compared the battlefield to Iraq and said that the book is every bit as original as the first in the series, ending the review with "Wow".</p>
<p><i>The Baltimore Sun</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Nancy Knight commented that the book "ends on an ostensibly happy note, but the heartbreaking effects of war and loss aren't sugar-coated" and that it will have readers thinking about the effects of war on society. Katie Roiphe of <i>The New York Times</i> said it is "the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world". However, she criticized that it was not as "impeccably plotted" as <i>The Hunger Games</i>. Bob Minzesheimer of <i>USA Today</i> gave the book three out of four stars. <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> reviewer Yvonne Zipp described it as "an entirely gripping read".</p>
<p>While a review from <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sacramento_Bee" title="The Sacramento Bee">The Sacramento Bee</a></i> praised the action scenes and the battle in the Capitol, the reviewer also criticized Collins for not giving enough time to finish all the loose ends, writing that "the disappointment with <i>Mockingjay</i> hits primarily as Collins starts her home stretch. It's almost as if she didn't allocate enough time or chapters to handle all her threads".</p>

Coulson is a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> agent who oversees many of the division's field operations. Though he appeared to have died at the hands of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(comics)" title="Loki (comics)">Loki</a> in <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="The Avengers (2012 film)">The Avengers</a></i>, he is revealed in the series pilot to have been revived by medical technicians after having been clinically dead for eight seconds. Speaking of his character's return from the dead, Gregg said, "When Joss described to me the mystery and the complexity and the unanswered questions about Phil Coulson standing there trying to deal with this, I found it so fascinating and so true to the world of the comics and mythology in general as I understand them that I was immediately in." The changes that Coulson has undergone since his survival from a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_death_experience" title="Near death experience" class="mw-redirect">near death experience</a> will be explored during the first season. Executive producer <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Bell" title="Jeffrey Bell">Jeffrey Bell</a> explains, "There is a lot that's strange and different about Coulson since his return to duty, and even he's noticing it. It sets him on a quest. "What happened to me? Why am I feeling this way? Who am I?" Executive producer <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb" title="Jeph Loeb">Jeph Loeb</a> adds that Coulson may regret uncovering his answers saying "When you start to pull on a thread, you run the risk of unraveling the whole sweater". Coulson is revealed to have been revived days after he died, and not mere minutes, in the episode "The Magical Place". In episode "T.A.H.I.T.I.", it is revealed that the serum used to revive Coulson is of alien origin.</li>

The experience was so horrific that she took an obscure desk job before Coulson recruits her in the series pilot. According to Wen, May "needed to be saved. She returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. out of loyalty to Coulson, but there's a part of her that remains reluctant. She still gets her pissed-off face. If it weren't for his intervention, she'd still be down in that dark, dingy room stapling things." The character was originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets. In the episode "Yes Men," she is revealed to be aware of how Coulson was resurrected, and to be spying on Coulson on behalf of Nick Fury, as revealed in "Turn, Turn, Turn".</li>

He is a gruff, unsociable "manly man" in his early 30's who is great at his job, but not so great at getting along with his coworkers. Ward has a strong moral foundation and is not without his charm. After a traumatic encounter in the episode "The Well," he begins a sexual affair with Agent May. The affair ends in the episode "Yes Men". Ward exhibits allegiance to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HYDRA" title="HYDRA">HYDRA</a> in "Turn, Turn, Turn".</li>

Skye is described as "bubbly and goofy" but "also warm, edgy and witty". She can more than hold her own in any situation. In "The Girl with the Flower Dress", it is revealed that Skye joined S.H.I.E.L.D. and Rising Tide in order to find out about her parents. In "Seeds", it is revealed that Skye was designated by S.H.I.E.L.D. as an '0-8-4' (object of unknown origin). After she is shot twice in the stomach and given hours to live in the episode "T.R.A.C.K.S.," she is subjected to the same regenerative serum used to revive Coulson, in "T.A.H.I.T.I". In "Yes Men," Coulson shares the secret alien nature of the serum with her, and the two make a pact to work together to uncover more information about it. She becomes a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the episode "End of the Beginning" with level 1 clearance.</li>

De Caestacker downplays the apparent romantic chemistry between Fitz and Simmons, insisting that Simmons is merely "motherly" toward Fitz. Described as "superorganized", the character keeps only bare essentials on his worktable, with the exception of a monkey figurine that is a nod to De Caestecker's obsession with monkeys.</li>

<p>After <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company">The Walt Disney Company</a> purchased <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Entertainment" title="Marvel Entertainment">Marvel Entertainment</a> in 2009, they announced that a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Television" title="Marvel Television">Marvel Television</a> division was being formed. In the following months, various pilots based on comics from Marvel's catalog went into development.</p>
<p>In July 2012, Marvel Television entered into discussions with <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> to do a new show set in the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe" title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, though at that point it was undecided what the show would be. It was described as <span style="padding-right:.2em;">"</span>'a kernel of an idea' with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show." In August 2012 it was announced that <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="The Avengers (2012 film)">Marvel's The Avengers</a></i> director <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon" title="Joss Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>, creator of cult hit shows such as <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(TV_series)" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)" class="mw-redirect">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></i> and <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)" title="Firefly (TV series)">Firefly</a></i>, would be involved in the show's development. A few weeks later ABC ordered a pilot for a show called <i>S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>; the pilot was to be written by Joss Whedon, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jed_Whedon" title="Jed Whedon">Jed Whedon</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurissa_Tancharoen" title="Maurissa Tancharoen">Maurissa Tancharoen</a>, directed by Joss Whedon, and executive produced by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, Jeffrey Bell and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb" title="Jeph Loeb">Jeph Loeb</a>, with Jed Whedon, Tancharoen and Bell slated to serve as the series' <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner" title="Showrunner">showrunners</a>. According to <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>, Disney CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger" title="Bob Iger">Bob Iger</a> greenlit the S.H.I.E.L.D. series after watching the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_One-Shot" title="Marvel One-Shot" class="mw-redirect">Marvel One-Shot</a> short film <i>Item 47</i>, about S.H.I.E.L.D. agents pursuing a couple in possession of a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitauri" title="Chitauri">Chitauri</a> weapon used in the Battle of New York in <i>The Avengers</i>. Joss Whedon stated that the show would be autonomous from <i>The Avengers</i>, saying "It’s gotta be a show that works for people who haven’t seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." In a September 2012 interview at the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_International_Film_Festival" title="Toronto International Film Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>, Whedon reiterated that sentiment, going on to say "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent [to <i>The Avengers</i>]... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [lack of powers] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." Whedon deflected any direct influences from other series, such as the efforts of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Mulder" title="Fox Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scully" title="Dana Scully">Dana Scully</a> in <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files" title="The X-Files">The X-Files</a></i>, and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on "the peripheral people ... the people on the edges of the grand adventures."</p>
<p>In January 2013, ABC president Paul Lee said that the story takes place after the events of <i>The Avengers</i>. Filming of the pilot episode began on January 22, 2013 and concluded on February 11, 2013. On April 6, 2013, ABC announced that the show would be titled <i>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> On May 10, 2013, ABC announced that it had officially picked up the series.</p>
<p>In a June 2013 interview, Clark Gregg explained how the TV series would tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: "...the exciting part is going to be seeing the way that <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier" title="Captain America: The Winter Soldier">Captain America 2</a></i>, and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show." Jed Whedon said the TV series will work in tandem with the Marvel films, both past and upcoming. “We plan on trying to weave in between the films and try to make them more rewarding on both ends,” said Whedon.</p>
<p>In July 2013, Maurissa Tancharoen revealed on her <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> page that Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, Jeff Bell, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Zbyszewski" title="Paul Zbyszewski">Paul Zbyszewski</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Breen" title="Monica Breen">Monica Owusu-Breen</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Fletcher" title="Brent Fletcher">Brent Fletcher</a>, Lauren LeFranc, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafe_Judkins" title="Rafe Judkins">Rafe Judkins</a> and Shalisha Francis would be the writers for the series. Additionally, composer <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_McCreary" title="Bear McCreary">Bear McCreary</a> confirmed that he would compose music for the series. On July 19, 2013, at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International" title="San Diego Comic-Con International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a>, the entire pilot was screened.</p>
<p>The main recurring setting for the series is the Bus, a retrofitted <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-17" title="Boeing C-17" class="mw-redirect">Boeing C-17</a>, that serves as both the transportation and headquarters of the titular team. The Bus includes such features as a soundproof interrogation room, a forensics and research lab located on the lower deck, where Fitz and Simmons work, and a cargo hold directly outside the lab where the team parks its SUV and Lola, Coulson's prized <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Corvette" title="Chevy Corvette" class="mw-redirect">Chevy Corvette</a>.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2013, ABC announced it ordered a full season of 22 episodes. The series ranks as the No. 1 series of the 2013–14 season among adults 18–49. On October 12, 2013, Marvel screened "Eye Spy" at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Comic_Con" title="New York Comic Con">New York Comic Con</a>. On March 23, 2014, Marvel screened "End of the Beginning" before its PaleyFest panel for the show. At the panel, the producers indicated that they and the writers are able to read the screenplays for upcoming MCU films to know where the universe is heading, which allowed them to form a general plan for the show through the end of a third season, should the show be renewed for such.</p>
<p>For the final six episodes of the season, Marvel revealed the "<i>Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>: The Art of Level Seven" initiative, in which a different image is released the Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative is a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the season. The production team tries to pair specific artists to the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connects to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. For "Turn, Turn, Turn", the image by Mike Del Mundo depicted a maze forming the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and show title, with a rat inside, hinting ominously at S.H.I.E.L.D.’s corruption and a possible traitor. For "Providence", <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Rivera" title="Paolo Rivera">Paolo Rivera</a> crafted the image, which highlights the rise of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HYDRA" title="HYDRA">HYDRA</a> by drawing a melded HYDRA and S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, and depicts the team divided by Coulson, Raina, and Ward. For "The Only Light in The Darkness", Pascal Champion's image focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_(comics)" title="Blackout (comics)">Marcus Daniels</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the events of the 2014 film <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier" title="Captain America: The Winter Soldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></i>, which revealed that HYDRA had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the series sees a retooling for the final six episodes of the first season. Loeb said, "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else out there in the entertainment business," regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films. The characters face the HYDRA issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Whedon added that the HYDRA element, which the show could not mention until after the release of <i>Winter Soldier</i> in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into HYDRA.</p>
<p>The series' first tie-in episode with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in the episode "The Well", which takes place after the events of the 2013 film <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor:_The_Dark_World" title="Thor: The Dark World">Thor: The Dark World</a></i>. A second tie-in takes place revolving around the events of <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>, in the episodes "End of the Beginning" and "Turn, Turn, Turn". Beginning with "T.A.H.I.T.I.", all episodes leading up to <i>The Winter Soldier</i> crossover were part of a series of episodes dubbed "Uprising".</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Casting">Casting</span></h3>
<p>In October 2012, a casting sheet for five lead roles was sent out. Later that month, at the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Comic_Con" title="New York Comic Con">New York Comic Con</a>, Joss Whedon, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige" title="Kevin Feige">Kevin Feige</a> and Clark Gregg announced that Gregg would be reprising his role as agent Phil Coulson in the series' pilot, and would "headline" the series. Toward the end of the month, actress <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming-Na_Wen" title="Ming-Na Wen">Ming-Na Wen</a> was cast as agent Melinda May. In November 2012, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Henstridge" title="Elizabeth Henstridge">Elizabeth Henstridge</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_De_Caestecker" title="Iain De Caestecker">Iain De Caestecker</a> were cast as agents Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, respectively. Later in November, newcomer <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dalton" title="Brett Dalton">Brett Dalton</a> was cast as agent Grant Ward. In December 2012, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bennet" title="Chloe Bennet">Chloe Bennet</a> was cast as Skye, the sixth and final series regular. In January 2013, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobie_Smulders" title="Cobie Smulders">Cobie Smulders</a>, who played agent <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Hill" title="Maria Hill">Maria Hill</a> in <i>The Avengers</i>, said that her character may make an appearance in the show and that her commitment to <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother" title="How I Met Your Mother">How I Met Your Mother</a></i> would not prevent her from participating. In April 2013, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._August_Richards" title="J. August Richards">J. August Richards</a>, one of the stars of Whedon's 1999 series <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_(TV_series)" title="Angel (TV series)" class="mw-redirect">Angel</a></i>, was also cast in the pilot in an unspecified role. When asked if Richards' role would be one familiar to the comics, executive producer Jeffrey Bell said, "You know, not necessarily. I mean, we’re going to draw from [the comics], but Marvel has its thing, and we’re also going to be expanding forward, and this world is different since <i>The Avengers</i>. So I think there will be people showing up, some from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a> and some not." <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></i> actor <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Brendon" title="Nicholas Brendon">Nicholas Brendon</a>, another Whedon collaborator, was also reportedly considered for Richards' role.

Joss Whedon stated: "I wanted very much to have Cobie in the pilot because as much as anyone else, she <i>is</i> S.H.I.E.L.D.

Critically, the initial screening of the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews.

<p><i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing—its continuity with Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of the <i>The Avengers</i> storyline, and Whedon's return to television—were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience. <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Brian Lowry felt that the "pilot picks up where <span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span><i>Avengers</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span> left off, but doesn't pack quite the same punch," adding that the banter "occasionally feels a little precious and clunky."</p>

For the second episode, Steranko said that it was "too unfocused to be satisfying," but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as "an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be." In contrast, Steranko's opinion of later episodes in the first season were largely positive, congratulating the writer and director of "The End of the Beginning" for "finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life", and saying of the next episode "I was concerned that last week’s bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup’s new image-and-edit policy was in play."</p>

In some cultures it can also be used interchangeably with other terms referring to trans women.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>The term has since become an unflattering term applied to male-to-female transsexual people. Psychologists Dana Finnegan and Emily Mcnally write that the term "tends to have demeaning connotations." French professor John Phillips writes that <i>shemale</i> is "a linguistic <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymoron" title="Oxymoron">oxymoron</a> that simultaneously reflects but, by its very impossibility, challenges <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary" title="Gender binary">[gender] binary</a> thinking, collapsing the divide between the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity" title="Masculinity">masculine</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femininity" title="Femininity">feminine</a>." Trans author <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Feinberg" title="Leslie Feinberg">Leslie Feinberg</a> writes, "'he-she' and 'she-male' describe the person's gender expression with the first pronoun and the birth sex with the second. The hyphenation signals a crisis of language and an apparent social contradiction, since sex and gender are 'supposed' to match." The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_and_Lesbian_Alliance_Against_Defamation" title="Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation" class="mw-redirect">Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation</a> has said the term is a "dehumanizing slur" and should not be used "except in a direct quote that reveals the bias of the person quoted."</p>
<p>Some have adopted the term as a self-descriptor but this is often in context of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_work" title="Sex work">sex work</a>. Transsexual author <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bornstein" title="Kate Bornstein">Kate Bornstein</a> wrote that a friend who self-identified as "she-male" described herself as "tits, big hair, lots of make-up, and a dick." Sex researchers Mildred Brown and Chloe Rounsley said, "She-males are men, often involved in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography" title="Pornography">pornography</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_entertainment" title="Adult entertainment" class="mw-redirect">adult entertainment</a> business, who have undergone breast augmentation but have maintained their genitalia." According to Professors Laura Castañeda and Shannon Campbell at the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a>'s <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annenberg_School_of_Journalism" title="Annenberg School of Journalism" class="mw-redirect">Annenberg School of Journalism</a>, "Using the term <i>she-male</i> for a transsexual woman would be considered highly offensive, for it implies that she is working 'in the [sex] trade.' It may be considered <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel" title="Libel" class="mw-redirect">libelous</a>." Melissa Hope Ditmore, of the Trafficked Persons Rights Project, notes the term "is an invention of the sex industry, and most transwomen find the term abhorrent." Biologist and transgender activist <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Serano" title="Julia Serano">Julia Serano</a> notes that it remains "derogatory or sensationalistic." According to sex columnist <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_Lynn" title="Regina Lynn">Regina Lynn</a>, "Porn marketers use 'she-male' for a very specific purpose — to sell porn to straight guys without triggering their homophobia — that has nothing to do with actual transgendered people (or helping men overcome their homophobia, either)." According to sex columnist <span class="new" title="Sasha (journalist) (page does not exist)">Sasha</span>, "The term shemale is used in this setting to denote a fetishized sexual persona and is not typically used by transgendered women outside of sex work. Many transgendered women are offended by this categorization and call themselves T-girls or trans."</p>

<p>In addition to its use in pornography, the term has been used as a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_line" title="Punch line">punch line</a> or for rhetorical effect.

<p>The word came under extreme criticism when it was used during episode four of RuPaul's Drag Race Season 6. Logo TV, the show's broadcast station, released a statement on April 14, 2014 saying: "We wanted to thank the community for sharing their concerns around a recent segment and the use of the term 'she-mail' on Drag Race. Logo has pulled the episode from all of our platforms and that challenge will not appear again. Furthermore, we are removing the 'You've got she-mail' intro from new episodes of the series. We did not intend to cause any offense, but in retrospect we realize that it was insensitive. We sincerely apologize."</p>

<p><i><b>Cloud Gate</b></i> (also known as "<b>The Bean</b>") is a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_art" title="Public art">public</a> sculpture by Indian-born British artist <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anish_Kapoor" title="Anish Kapoor">Anish Kapoor</a>, that is the centerpiece of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Plaza" title="AT&amp;T Plaza">AT&amp;T Plaza</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Park" title="Millennium Park">Millennium Park</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop" title="Chicago Loop">Loop</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_of_Chicago" title="Community areas of Chicago" class="mw-redirect">community area</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>. The sculpture and AT&amp;T Plaza are located on top of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Grill" title="Park Grill">Park Grill</a>, between the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Promenade" title="Chase Promenade">Chase Promenade</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormick_Tribune_Plaza_%26_Ice_Rink" title="McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink">McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink</a>. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is made up of 168 <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel" title="Stainless steel">stainless steel</a> plates welded together, and its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13&nbsp;m), and weighs 110 short tons (100&nbsp;t; 98 long tons).</p>
<p>Said to have been inspired by liquid <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under <i>Cloud Gate'</i>s 12-foot (3.7&nbsp;m) high arch. On the underside is the "omphalos" (Greek for "navel"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(visual_arts)" title="Theme (visual arts)" class="mw-redirect">themes</a>, and is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.</p>
<p>The sculpture was selected during a design competition. After Kapoor's design was chosen, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Various experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. It was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration in 2004, before being concealed again while it was completed. <i>Cloud Gate</i> was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.</p>

For 2007, the park was Chicago's second largest tourist attraction, trailing only <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Pier" title="Navy Pier">Navy Pier</a>.</p>
<p>In 1999, Millennium Park officials and a group of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_collector" title="Art collector" class="mw-redirect">art collectors</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator" title="Curator">curators</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect" title="Architect">architects</a> reviewed the artistic works of 30&nbsp;different artists and asked two for proposals. American artist <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Koons" title="Jeff Koons">Jeff Koons</a> submitted a proposal to erect a permanent 150-foot (46&nbsp;m) sculpture of a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playground_slide" title="Playground slide">playground slide</a>; his glass and steel design featured an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_deck" title="Observation deck">observation deck</a> 90 feet (27&nbsp;m) above the ground that was accessible via an elevator. The committee chose the second design by internationally acclaimed artist <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anish_Kapoor" title="Anish Kapoor">Anish Kapoor</a>. Measuring 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13&nbsp;m) and weighing 110 short tons (100&nbsp;t; 98 long tons), the proposal featured a seamless, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel" title="Stainless steel">stainless steel</a> surface inspired by liquid <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>. This mirror-like surface would reflect the Chicago skyline, but its elliptical shape would distort and twist the reflected image. As visitors walk around the structure, its surface acts like a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_mirror" title="Curved mirror">fun-house mirror</a> as it distorts their reflections.</p>

<p>In the underside of the sculpture is the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos" title="Omphalos">omphalos</a>, an indentation whose mirrored surface provides multiple reflections of any subject situated beneath it. The apex of the omphalos is 27 feet (8.2&nbsp;m) above the ground. The concave underside allows visitors to walk underneath to see the omphalos, and through its arch to the other side so that they view the entire structure. During the grand opening week in July 2004, press reports described the omphalos as the "spoon-like underbelly". The stainless steel sculpture was originally envisioned as the centerpiece of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurie_Garden" title="Lurie Garden">Lurie Garden</a> at the southeast corner of the park. However, Park officials believed the piece was too large for the Lurie Garden and decided to locate it at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Plaza" title="AT&amp;T Plaza">AT&amp;T Plaza</a>, despite Kapoor's objections. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">Skyscrapers</a> to the north along East <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_Street" title="Randolph Street" class="mw-redirect">Randolph Street</a>, including <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_at_Millennium_Park" title="The Heritage at Millennium Park">The Heritage</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurfit-Stone_Building" title="Smurfit-Stone Building" class="mw-redirect">Smurfit-Stone Building</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Prudential_Plaza" title="Two Prudential Plaza">Two Prudential Plaza</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Prudential_Plaza" title="One Prudential Plaza">One Prudential Plaza</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aon_Center_(Chicago)" title="Aon Center (Chicago)">Aon Center</a> are visible, reflected on both the east and west sides of the sculpture.</p>
<p>Although Kapoor does not draw with computers, computer modeling was essential to the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat in a way that would make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti" title="Graffiti">Graffiti</a>, bird droppings and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint" title="Fingerprint">fingerprints</a> were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_(metallurgy)" title="Seam (metallurgy)" class="mw-redirect">seamless</a> exterior for the external shell, a feat architect <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Foster,_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank" title="Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank">Norman Foster</a> once believed to be nearly impossible.</p>
<p>While the sculpture was being constructed, public and media outlets nicknamed it "The Bean" because of its leguminous shape, a name that Kapoor described as "completely stupid". Months later, Kapoor officially named the piece "Cloud Gate". Critical reviews describe the sculpture as a passage between realms. Three-quarters of the sculpture's external surface reflects the sky and the name refers to it acting as a type of gate that helps bridge the space between the sky and the viewer. The sculpture and plaza are sometimes referred to jointly as "<i>Cloud Gate</i> on the AT&amp;T Plaza". It is Kapoor's first public outdoor work in the United States, and is the work by which he is best known in the country according to the <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times" title="Financial Times">Financial Times</a></i>.</p>

<p>The British engineering firm <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier_One" title="Atelier One">Atelier One</a> and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later went on to form the engineering firm Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrication_(metal)" title="Fabrication (metal)" class="mw-redirect">fabricate</a> it because of their ability to produce nearly invisible <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welding" title="Welding">welds</a>. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane" title="Polyurethane">polyurethane</a> foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a>, and ship it to Chicago through the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_Seaway" title="St. Lawrence Seaway" class="mw-redirect">St. Lawrence Seaway</a>. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so the decision was made to transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.</p>
<p>The sculpture's weight raised concerns. Estimating the thickness of the steel needed to create the sculpture's desired aesthetics before fabrication was difficult. <i>Cloud Gate</i> was originally estimated to weigh 60 short tons (54&nbsp;t; 54 long tons) when completed. However, the final figure was almost twice as heavy at 110 short tons (100&nbsp;t; 98 long tons). This extra weight required engineers to reconsider the sculpture's supporting structures. The roof of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Grill" title="Park Grill">Park Grill</a>, upon which <i>Cloud Gate</i> sits, had to be built strong enough to bear the weight. The large retaining wall separating Chicago's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metra" title="Metra">Metra</a> train tracks from the North <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Park_(Chicago)" title="Grant Park (Chicago)">Grant Park</a> garage supports much of the weight of the sculpture and forms the back side of the restaurant. This wall, along with the rest of the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected. <i>Cloud Gate</i> is further <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttress" title="Buttress">buttressed</a> by lateral members underneath the plaza that are anchored to the sculpture's interior structure by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_rod" title="Tie rod">tie rods</a>.</p>
<p>Inside <i>Cloud Gate</i>'s polished exterior shell are several steel structures that keep the sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel#Stainless_steel_grades" title="Stainless steel">type 304 stainless steel</a> rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss" title="Truss">trusses</a> were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.</p>

<p>When <i>Cloud Gate'</i>s interior components were completed, construction crews prepared to work on the outer shell; this comprises 168&nbsp;stainless steel panels, each <span class="frac nowrap"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub></span> inch (10&nbsp;mm) thick and weighing 1,000 to 2,000 <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)" title="Pound (mass)">pounds</a> (450 to 910&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kg</a>). They were fabricated using three-dimensional modeling software. Computers and robots were essential in the bending and shaping of the plates, which was performed by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_wheel" title="English wheel">English wheel</a> and a robotic scanning device. Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland. The plates were polished to 98&nbsp;percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks. Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442&nbsp;linear feet (744&nbsp;m) of welded seams. Welders used <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser-hybrid_welding" title="Laser-hybrid welding">keyhole welding machines</a> rather than traditional welding guns. The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position.</p>
<p>When construction of the shell began in June 2004, a large tent was erected around the piece to shield it from public view. Construction began with the omphalos, where plates were attached to the supporting internal steel structure, from the inside (underside) of the sculpture downward to the outermost surfaces. This sequence caused the structure to resemble a large <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero" title="Sombrero">sombrero</a> when the bottom was complete.</p>
<p>The shell of <i>Cloud Gate</i> was fully erected for the grand opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, although it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Bridge,_Structural,_Ornamental_and_Reinforcing_Iron_Workers" title="International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers">Ironworkers Local 63</a> polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding" title="Scaffolding">scaffolding</a> were erected around the sides of the sculpture, while <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_equipment" title="Climbing equipment" class="mw-redirect">climbing ropes</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_harness" title="Climbing harness">harnesses</a> were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the <i>Cloud Gate</i> underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.</p>
<p>The sculpture was finally completed on August 28, 2005, and officially unveiled on May 15, 2006. The cost for the piece was first estimated at $6&nbsp;million; this had escalated to $11.5&nbsp;million by the time the park opened in 2004, with the final figure standing at $23&nbsp;million in 2006. No public funds were involved; all funding came from donations from individuals and corporations.</p>
<p>Kapoor's contract states that the constructed piece should be expected to survive for 1,000&nbsp;years. The lower 6 feet (1.8&nbsp;m) of <i>Cloud Gate</i> is wiped down twice a day by hand, while the entire sculpture is cleaned twice a year with 40 U.S. gallons (33&nbsp;imp&nbsp;gal; 150&nbsp;L) of liquid detergent. The daily cleanings use a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windex" title="Windex">Windex</a>-like solution, while the semi-annual cleanings use <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_(brand)" title="Tide (brand)">Tide</a>. A notable February 2009 rare incident saw two names etched in letters about 1 inch (25&nbsp;mm) tall on the northeast side of the curved sculpture. The graffiti was removed by the same firm that did the original polishing.</p>

<p>"What I wanted to do in Millennium Park is make something that would engage the Chicago skyline&nbsp;... so that one will see the clouds kind of floating in, with those very tall buildings reflected in the work. And then, since it is in the form of a gate, the participant, the viewer, will be able to enter into this very deep chamber that does, in a way, the same thing to one's reflection as the exterior of the piece is doing to the reflection of the city around."</p>

<p>When the park first opened in 2004, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metra" title="Metra">Metra</a> police stopped a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_College_Chicago" title="Columbia College Chicago">Columbia College Chicago</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism" title="Journalism">journalism</a> student who was working on a photography project in Millennium Park and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism. In 2005, the sculpture attracted some controversy when a professional <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographer" title="Photographer">photographer</a> without a paid permit was denied access to the piece. As is the case for all works of art currently covered by United States <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> law, the artist holds the copyright for the sculpture. This allows the public to freely photograph <i>Cloud Gate</i>, but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. The city first set a policy of collecting permit fees for photographs. These permits were initially set at $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videographer" title="Videographer">videographers</a> and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring ten-person crews and equipment.</p>
<p>In addition to restricting photography of public art, closing a public park for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, as one of the park's primary attractions, <i>Cloud Gate</i> was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Motor_Sales_USA" title="Toyota Motor Sales USA" class="mw-redirect">Toyota Motor Sales USA</a> paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including <i>Cloud Gate</i> on AT&amp;T Plaza from 6&nbsp;a.m. to 11&nbsp;p.m. On August 7, 2006, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allstate" title="Allstate">Allstate</a> paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to <i>Cloud Gate</i> after 4&nbsp;p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park were forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that the money would help to finance free public programs in Millennium Park.</p>

<p>"I hope what I have done is make a serious work, which deals with serious questions about form, public space and an object in space. You can capture the popular imagination and hold other points of interest, but that is not what I set out to do, although there is inevitably a certain spectacular in an object like this."</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">—<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anish_Kapoor" title="Anish Kapoor">Anish Kapoor</a></div>
</div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anish_Kapoor" title="Anish Kapoor">Anish Kapoor</a> has a reputation for creating spectacles in urban settings by producing works of extreme size and scale. Before creating <i>Cloud Gate</i>, Kapoor had created art that distorted images of the viewer instead of portraying images of its own. In so doing, he acquired experience blurring the boundary between the limit and the limitless. Kapoor drew on past experience to design <i>Cloud Gate</i>, in particular the designing of <i><a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Mirror" title="Sky Mirror">Sky Mirror</a></i> (2001), a 20-foot (6.1&nbsp;m) 10-short-ton (9&nbsp;t; 9-long-ton) concave stainless steel mirror that also used a theme of distorted perception on a grand scale.</p>
<p>Kapoor's objects often aim to evoke immateriality and the spiritual, an outcome he achieves either by carving dark voids into stone pieces, or more recently, through the sheer shine and reflectivity of his objects. This Indian artist's works have no fixed identity, but rather occupy an illusionary space that is consistent with eastern theologies shared by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, as well as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s views of a non-three-dimensional world. Kapoor explores the theme of ambiguity with his works that place the viewer in a state of "in-betweenness". The artist often questions and plays with such dualities as solidity–emptiness or reality–reflection, which in turn allude to such paired opposites as flesh–spirit, the here–the beyond, east–west, sky–earth, etc. that create the conflict between internal and external, superficial and subterranean, and conscious and unconscious. Kapoor also creates a tension between masculine and feminine within his art by having concave points of focus that invite the entry of visitors and multiplies their images when they are positioned correctly.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cloud_Gate_themes"><i>Cloud Gate</i> themes</span><a target="_blank" href="#editor/6" data-section="6" class="edit-page">Edit</a></h3>
<p>Kapoor often speaks of removing both the signature of the artist from his works as well as any traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as "traces of the hand". He aspires to make his works look like they have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates. For him, removing all the seams from <i>Cloud Gate</i> was necessary in order to make the sculpture seem as though it was "perfect" and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from. His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry" title="Frank Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>'s architectural designs in the park, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Pritzker_Pavilion" title="Jay Pritzker Pavilion">Jay Pritzker Pavilion</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP_Pedestrian_Bridge" title="BP Pedestrian Bridge">BP Pedestrian Bridge</a>, which display their seams prominently.</p>

<p><i>Cloud Gate</i> is described as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. <i>Cloud Gate</i> is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, <i>Cloud Gate</i> limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture is described as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier <i>1000 Names</i> (1979–80) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.</p>
<p>The viewer physically enters the art when he walks underneath it into its "navel". The omphalos is a "warped dimension of fluid space". In this dimension, solid is transformed into fluid in a disorienting multiplicative manner that intensifies the experience. It is emblematic of Kapoor's work to deconstruct empirical space and venture into <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold" title="Manifold">manifold</a> possibilities of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_space" title="Abstract space">abstract space</a>. The experience is described as a displaced or virtual depth that is composed of multiplied surfaces.</p>
<p>According to project manager Lou Cerny of MTH Industries, "When the light is right, you can't see where the sculpture ends and the sky begins." The sculpture challenges perception by distorting and deforming the surrounding architecture. The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a> along East <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_Street" title="Randolph Street" class="mw-redirect">Randolph Street</a> to the northeast (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Prudential_Plaza" title="Two Prudential Plaza">Two Prudential Plaza</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aon_Center_(Chicago)" title="Aon Center (Chicago)">Aon Center</a>), north (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Prudential_Plaza" title="One Prudential Plaza">One Prudential Plaza</a>) and northwest (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_at_Millennium_Park" title="The Heritage at Millennium Park">The Heritage</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurfit-Stone_Building" title="Smurfit-Stone Building" class="mw-redirect">Smurfit-Stone Building</a>) are reflected on <i>Cloud Gate'</i>s surface when viewed from either the east or the west. The sculpture also warps viewers' perception of time by changing the speed of movements such as the passing of clouds.</p>
<p>Although in the conventional sense <i>Cloud Gate</i> is not an opening that leads anywhere in the same way that monumental gates do, it frames a view and is celebratory in the way it creates a ceremonial place. The work is credited with achieving a new level or understanding described as a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation" title="Transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a> of material, reminiscent of that which the artist experienced during a 1979 trip to India. Kapoor's <i>1000 Names</i> evolved immediately after this trip; twenty-five years later he created <i>Cloud Gate</i>, an object that emerged from material forms to become immaterial.</p>
<p>Kapoor often relies on tenets of Hinduism in his art, and says that "The experience of opposites allows for the expression of wholeness." Primal dualities that are one, such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingam" title="Lingam">lingam</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoni" title="Yoni">yoni</a>, are important to Indian culture, and <i>Cloud Gate</i> represents both the male and female in one entity by symbolizing both the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina" title="Vagina">vagina</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle" title="Testicle">testicles</a>. Thus, it represents the tension between the masculine and the feminine.</p>
