{{Main article|Love & Monsters}}
Alien creatures, nicknamed "Abzorbaloffs", that can absorb any living thing into its body by touch and then digest the organism; one said Ursula Blake "tasted like chicken". The faces of its prey are visible on its body and are fully conscious of their surroundings. They are from the planet Clom, the twin planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius, the home planet of the Slitheen family. An Abzorbalovian disguised itself as "Victor Kennedy" and infiltrated LINDA - a group of people trying to track down the Doctor - although it planned to absorb the Doctor's knowledge. But Elton Pope broke its cane, which was a limitation field that kept its absorbing abilities under control. Without the protecting field, the Abzorbaloff was absorbed into the Earth.

The Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode "[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]". Their breeding world, Adipose 3, was lost, causing them to turn to "[[Miss Foster]]", or Matron Cofelia of the Five Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet, Intergalactic Class, to create a new generation. She formulated a drug that would cause human fat ([[adipose tissue]]) to morph by [[parthenogenesis]] into Adipose children. The process is generally harmless to the host beyond the loss of body fat; but in emergencies the process can be accelerated, converting the host's entire body, which is fatal to the host and produces ill and weak Adipose children.<ref name="Partners">{{cite episode | title = [[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 2008-04-05}}</ref> The [[Shadow Proclamation]].<ref name="MonsterFiles">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/?episode=S4_01&character=&action=videostream&playlist=/doctorwho/playlists/s4_01/video/s4_01_v_01.xml&video=1&date=&summary=Captain%20Jack%20reveals%20facts,%20figures%20and%20top%20secret%20info%20about%20the%20Adipose.&info=&info2=&info3=|title=The Monster Files|publisher=BBC |date=5 April 2008|accessdate=7 April 2008}}</ref> forbids seeding, or breeding aliens, on a level-5 planet such as Earth. Level 5 means pre-warp capabilities, as said in "Partners in Crime." According to the "Captain Jack's Monster Files" webcast about the Adipose, the children have been made [[Ward (law)|wards]] of the Shadow Proclamation, implying that the Adipose First Family have been sentenced for their crimes.

In the parallel universe created in "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]", the Adipose incident happened in America instead of the United Kingdom, as London was destroyed when the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace because of the absence of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] ("[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]"). Over 60 million Americans (roughly 20% of the total population of the United States) were killed in this timeline as a result.

In "[[The Stolen Earth]]" and "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]" it is revealed that the breeding planet, Adipose 3, was one of the 27 planets relocated to the Medusa Cascade by the New [[Dalek]] Empire. After their defeat, Adipose 3 and the other planets were returned to their original positions.

In "[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]", an Adipose is shown in a bar along with other aliens the Tenth Doctor had previously encountered. Five Adipose [[action figure]]s were released as part of the first series 4 wave.

===Bane===
{{Main article|Invasion of the Bane|Enemy of the Bane}}
The '''Bane''', in their natural form, are large tentacled aliens with one eye. They appear in ''[[Invasion of the Bane]]'' and ''[[Enemy of the Bane]]''. They exhibit some level of mind-reading abilities. [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Bane Mother|Bane Mothers]] are particularly large, and are known to eat members of their young who fail them. They are able to appear human through the use of image translators. The Bane sought to enslave mankind by getting them addicted to the soft drink, ''Bubble Shock!'', which contained an organic Bane secretion that would take control of its human host when activated. [[Mrs Wormwood]] headed the Bane's disguised human front and created the [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Archetype]], Luke.

===The Blessing===
<!--Felt that the significance of this necessitated a listing somewhere, was not sure where to put it. Please move if feel more relevant to Torchwood items/or Torchwood characters -->
In "[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]" '''The Blessing''' is revealed to be an [[Antipodes|antipodal]] geological formation connected to the Earth's [[morphic field]] running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires. [[Jack Harkness]] theorises that it may have been caused by the interaction of [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Racnoss|Racnoss]] Huon particles and [[Silurian]] hibernation matrixes, though its origins are unknown. The Families are unsure of whether or not to classify the Blessing as alive, though it is stated to have a degree of sentience. One of its features is that it has the ability to show approachings human the content of their own souls, which has caused some to commit suicide, others to find conviction. [[List of Torchwood characters#The Mother|The Mother]] believed that this reaction was a result of the Blessing attempting to communicate with the human race.

In "[[The Blood Line]]" it is revealed that the worldwide immortality investigated by Torchwood was a result of Jack's blood being introduced to The Blessing's [[morphic field]]. It is implied that this was a result of the Blessing interpreting The Families' interference as a threat, and the subsequent immortality being a gift of kindness to humanity. Jack and Rex (who has been infused with Jack's blood) manage to reset the Miracle through exposing it to Jack's (now mortal) blood at each end of the Blessing. But the Blessing does not reset everything back to the way it was and, perhaps as a result of the presence of Jack's blood, brings Rex back as also immortal.

A young blowfish appears in the episode "[[Fragments (Torchwood)|Fragments]]", in flashback sequences involving Jack's first mission for the Torchwood Institute, during which Jack captures the fish for committing various crimes but is outraged when it is shot after being captured.

A blowfish and two other fish-like creatures appear in the ''[[Torchwood Magazine]]'' short story ''The Book of Jahi''. The blowfish has taken on the name Mr. Glee and has been operating as a crime boss in Cardiff for some time.

The blowfish appeared in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" as part of The Alliance formed to trap the Doctor. An inanimate stored Blowfish appears in Hedgewick's World of Wonders in the series-seven episode, "[[Nightmare in Silver]]", visited by [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]].

A translucent humanoid who [[Spirit possession|possessed]] the body of a 19th-century prostitute named Mary was encountered in the episode "[[Greeks Bearing Gifts (Torchwood)|Greeks Bearing Gifts]]". She was a member of a race which communicated exclusively via [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[List of Torchwood items#A|pendants]], and claimed to be a political exile, sent to Earth by a [[List of Torchwood items#Two person transporter ship|teleporter]] now in Torchwood's possession. At one point, "Mary" calls herself [[Philoctetes]], in reference to his exile on [[Lemnos]]. She gave her telepathic necklace to Toshiko, and seduced her into letting her into Torchwood to regain the teleporter.

On arriving on Earth in 1812, the alien killed her guard and possessed Mary. In this form she needed to consume human hearts to maintain the host's youth, taking one a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/lowry/notes.shtml |title=Operation Lowry: Notes from Owen |publisher=Torchwood.org.uk |accessdate=2011-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203222258/http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/lowry/notes.shtml |archivedate=3 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> "Mary" threatened Tosh in order to regain the teleporter and Jack exchanged it for Tosh.

In ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' episode "[[Invasion of the Bane]]", [[Sarah Jane Smith]] helps an alien of the same race to find its way home. It is later revealed that this alien was a "[[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures monsters and aliens#Arcateenians|star poet]]", from [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Arcateen V]], who gave Sarah Jane a device via which she promised to help her with her poetry whenever she needs it.

Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains unclear.

"Mary" possessed [[superhuman strength|strength]] large enough to shatter human bones in a manner resembling a gunshot and could move at superhuman speeds, also possessing acute senses able to notice that there was something different about Jack. The poet alien in ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' was able to fly home with some assistance from Sarah Jane Smith. "Mary's" opinions of her human form seemed to be mixed: she disliked watching people talk using conventional speech; which was considered archaic on her home world, but she said she liked the body which she found "so soft, so wicked". She also expressed a dim view of human nature, considering humans to be a race who inherently desired to invade others.

A letter to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' noted "Mary"'s strong resemblance to [[Destrii]], a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] from the magazine's [[Eighth Doctor]] comic strips. The magazine's editors concurred with the observation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hawden, James |editor=[[Clayton Hickman]] |date=2007-01-31 |title=DWMail |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=378 |page=9}}</ref> Later, ''The Torchwood Archives'' by [[Gary Russell]] specified that Destrii and Mary are from the same system.

The '''Chelonians''' are a race of cybernetic humanoid [[tortoise]]s who have appeared in various [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] novels. They are a war-like race from the planet Chelonia. They are [[hermaphroditic]] and lay eggs. Some of their cybernetic enhancements include [[X-ray vision]] and improved hearing.

The first appearance of the Chelonians was in the [[Seventh Doctor]] [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[The Highest Science]]'' by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]]. They returned in ''[[Zamper]]'' and also featured in the [[Fourth Doctor]] missing adventure ''[[The Well-Mannered War]]'', as well as in the short stories ''The Hungry Bomb'', ''Fegovy'', and ''The Body Bank'', all by Gareth Roberts and published in, respectively, the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Yearbook 1995'', the anthology ''Decalog 3: Consequences'', and the ''Doctor Who Storybook 2008''. They are also mentioned in the New Adventures books ''[[Oh No It Isn't!]]'' and ''[[Beyond the Sun (Bernice Summerfield)|Beyond the Sun]]'', featuring Bernice Summerfield.   [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] listed the Chelonians amongst the races with fleets orbiting Earth in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]".

Chelonians consider humans to be [[parasitism|parasites]] and often try to eliminate them. There is a pacifist faction, however, and at some point following the Doctor's recorded encounters with them, that faction took control and their society began devoting its energies to [[floristry|flower arrangement]].

===Cyberman===
{{Main article|Cyberman}}
The original '''Cybermen''' were a race of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet [[Mondas]]. As they implanted more and more artificial parts into their bodies as a means of self-preservation, they became coldly logical and calculating, with emotion all but deleted from their minds. The Cybermen also have a rivalry with the [[Daleks]].

In "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]"/"[[The Age of Steel]]" of the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second revived series]], the Cybermen originate on a parallel-universe version of Earth, where they were created by [[John Lumic]], a genius obsessed with immortality. He forcibly 'upgraded' vast numbers of people in the parallel earth before a counter-revolution, initiated by the Doctor, started fighting back.

The Cyberman concept was created by Dr. [[Kit Pedler]] (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and [[Gerry Davis (screenwriter)|Gerry Davis]] in 1966.  Their first appearance was in the serial ''[[The Tenth Planet]]''. They have since been featured numerous times in their efforts to conquer and convert humanity to [[cyborg]]s like themselves.

A race of humanoids from the planet Dæmos.  Their appearance is that of classic demons, because Earth's notion of demons derives from them.  They are not exactly evil, but have a morality much different from humans, and have no qualms about doing humans harm.

===Dalek===
{{Main article|Dalek}}
A warlike race of mutant creatures who live within mobile battle armor. They are lifelong enemies of The Doctor, and he is the only being whom they fear. They are bent on destroying all life forms in the universe other than themselves. The creatures themselves resemble squid, with a single eye, exposed brain and many tentacles. They first appeared in the 1963 serial [[The Daleks]], the second Doctor Who serial.

A '''Dalek puppet''' is a living or dead creature that has been partially converted into a Dalek by [[Dalek]] [[List of Doctor Who items#Nanogenes|nanogenes]]. Puppets normally retain their original appearance but, in humanoids, when activated can extrude a miniature Dalek eyestalk and gunstick—in; the eyestalk coming from the forehead and the gunstick from the hand. If needed, the subject's pre-puppet memories can be accessed. Victims can be brought back to their senses by repeated insults to their character, such as the Doctor gave [[The Time of the Doctor|Tasha Lem]]. [[Time Lord]]s cannot be converted into Dalek puppets.

===Demon===
'''Demons''' have appeared in ''Doctor Who'' several times, the first being in [[Third Doctor]] serial ''[[The Dæmons]]''; there, they were specifically aliens from the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#D|Dæmos]] who had come to Earth in the distant past, with their existence becoming ingrained in myth.  The "demon" [[List of Doctor Who villains#Azal|Azal]] was summoned by the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]]'s will for ill purposes that the Doctor, with the literally vital aid of Jo Grant, was able to block.

In 2006, both the [[Tenth Doctor]] series of ''Doctor Who'' and its spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' expanded on the possibility of actual malicious supernatural entities existing in the [[Whoniverse|''Doctor Who'' universe]]. "[[The Impossible Planet]]" introduced the [[Beast (Doctor Who)|Beast]], a [[Satan]]-like demon remaining from the universe before our own, sealed in planet [[Kembel|Krop Tor]] by the "Disciples of Light".

Later, in the ''Torchwood'' episode "[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]"', the villainous [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Bilis Manger|Bilis Manger]] freed "[[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#Abaddon|Abaddon]], son of the great Beast" from within the [[Rift (Whoniverse)|Rift]], where he, like the Beast, had been imprisoned since "before time".  Manger had schemed to ensure [[Abaddon]]'s freedom, manipulating the Torchwood Three crew. Bilis refers to Abaddon as his "god". Abaddon killed all those who fell in his shadow; he devoured life. [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack]] attempted to sacrifice himself by using his [[immortality]] to destroy the demon when it tried to absorb too much, leaving Jack dead for days but causing the monster to choke to death. It is also referred to in Series 2 of ''Doctor Who'' by the [[Ood]] in the episode "The Impossible Planet" in terms of Beast's various aliases: "Some may call it Abaddon."

===Draconian===

The '''Draconians''' (also called '''Dragons''', a derogatory term) are a humanoid race encountered in the 26th century. They have tall, pointed heads with prominent brows, pointed ears, and patches of scaly skin. Common interstellar travel and attempts at colonization have brought them into frequent and occasionally hostile contact with humans, leading to a treaty establishing a frontier between the two empires. The Draconians are very intelligent, honorable, and at least as advanced as their human counterparts. They have appeared only in the [[Third Doctor]] serial [[Frontier in Space]]. The Doctor mentioned that he [[arm wrestle]]d with one at [[The Time of the Doctor|some point]].

==E==

===The Eminence===
The Eminence is a gestalt entity which exists as a brown gas which suffocates humanoid life forms before possessing them and turning them into deathless footsoldiers for its army. Its first appearance was in the Sixth Doctor Audio Adventure ''[[The Seeds of War (Doctor Who)|The Seeds of War]]''. It has since been present throughout the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Dark Eyes (Doctor Who)|Dark Eyes]] series featuring the Eighth Doctor, and has featured in the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Fourth Doctor Adventures|Fourth Doctor audio play]] episode ''Destroy the Infinite''.

===Fendahl===
{{Main article|Image of the Fendahl}}
A race that never exceeds [[unlucky number]] [[13 (number)|13]]; it is composed of one Golden Core and 12 Fendahleen. The Fendahl arose on the original fifth planet of our solar system, which they eventually wiped of all other life; so dangerous were they that the Time Lords moved the planet into a time loop.  Somehow, though, the Fendahl managed to eject a skull, which passed through space (seriously harming life on Mars as it passed) to land on Earth, where its powers helped shape humanity, a new vessel for the Fendahl.  Ages later, that skull was found by scientists, who believed it could grant them power; the attempt unfortunately backfired in the creation of a new Golden Core. The Core began creating Fendahleen, but one person suicided, preventing the Fendahl from reaching the quota. The Fourth Doctor blew up the house the Fendahl were in, and later tossed the skull that caused the trouble into a supernova.

The Fendahl also appear in the ''Doctor Who'' novel ''[[The Taking of Planet 5]]''.

===Foamasi===
{{Doctor Who race

The '''Foamasi''' are an intelligent, bipedal race of [[reptile]]s resembling humanoid [[chameleon]]s; they appeared in the 1980 [[Fourth Doctor]] story ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'', by [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]]. The race's name is a near-anagram of the word "[[mafia|mafioso]]". The Foamasi fought and won a 20-minute [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the [[#Argolin|Argolin]]. They communicate by means of chirps and clicks, translated by an interpreting device held in the mouth. Although they became mostly a peaceful race from having learned the error of their ways from the devastating war, a renegade faction called the West Lodge exists and frequently attempts to revive hostilities between the two races.

After their victory, the Argolin's home planet of [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Argolis]] was officially owned by the Foamasi government. Two saboteurs from the West Lodge tried to force the Argolins to sell them the Leisure Hive, so they could use it as a new base. They were thwarted by a group of Foamasi, one claiming to be a member of the Foamasi government, who used a web-spewing gun to ensnare them and return them to their home planet. Some Foamasi disguise themselves as humanoids by fitting into skin-suits which are smaller than the Foamasi's own bodies.

A Foamasi assassin appears in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''Placebo Effect'' by [[Gary Russell]]. In this novel, it is explained that the Foamasi can fit into disguises smaller than their bodies because their bones are hollow and collapsible.

===Gelth===

The '''Gelth''' appeared in the [[Ninth Doctor]] episode "[[The Unquiet Dead]]". They were a new race of alien villains that the [[Ninth Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler]] encountered in the 2005 series. They were the first element of the new series that attracted attention for being "too scary".<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Plunkett|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/14/bbc.broadcasting|title=Doctor Who 'too scary', say parents|work=The Guardian|date=14 April 2005|accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> Following complaints, many of which were made by [[Mediawatch UK]], the [[BBC]] stated that in future, episodes of that nature would be forewarned by a statement of "may not be suitable for under 8s".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Gelth were blue gaseous life-forms. They claimed to have lost their corporeal forms as a consequence of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], though later actions by the Gelth put the truth of this statement in doubt. They arrived on Earth via [[Rift (Whoniverse)|the spacetime rift]] at an undertaker's house in [[Cardiff]] in 1869. Their forms could not be maintained in Earth's atmosphere without suspension in a gaseous medium, so they inhabited the gas pipes common to [[Victorian era]] households.  Further, though, they also would take possession of recently deceased corpses. When possessing corpses, they look much like ordinary humans (provided that the corpse has yet to enter the [[autolytic]] stage of [[decomposition]]), with only two fundamental differences: their irises vanish or turn white, and blue veins are clearly visible on their ghastly pale skin. Gelth make an unearthly shrieking noise for an unknown reason, particularly when they've possessed someone.

Claiming to be on the verge of extinction, the Gelth convinced the Doctor to aid their entrance to Earth via Gwyneth, the undertaker's servant girl, who had developed psychic powers due to growing up near the rift. The Gelth actually numbered in the billions and intended to take the Earth by force, and to use its murdered population as vessels for themselves. The Gelth were thwarted when Gwyneth sacrificed herself, blowing up the building and sealing the rift. Whether all the Gelth that came through the rift perished is unclear.

In "[[Army of Ghosts]]", Rose asked whether "ghostshifting" Cybermen might have been Gelth, which the Doctor stated was not the case.

In "[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]", Donna Noble compared Agatha Christie being surrounded by murders to meeting Charles Dickens at Christmas while he's surrounded by ghosts. The Tenth Doctor gave a "Well..." to a disbelieving Donna; Charles Dickens was with his previous incarnation and Rose when the Gelth attempted to attack at Christmas, and the gaseous form of the Gelth could lead to their being classed "ghosts".
