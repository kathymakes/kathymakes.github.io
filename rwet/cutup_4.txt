Open watercolor paper
to a new sheet
Turn back the sheet
Begin by painting primary red
along with various shades of red
gray, off-white, tan
or various shades of brown

Let it dry
touch it up
brightening
adding details

Paint the scene
Even though snow is white,
it picks up lots of colors
in the shadow areas
reflect the color of the sky

rather than a flat surface
rises and depressions add interest
Small heaps of snow,
larger hills
or even mountains in the distance
All of these are opportunities
to create blue or violet indentations
shadows in the snow

add trees if you wish
all types and shapes of trees
are a welcome addition to a winter scene

Step back and imagine possibilities
for the sky
it could be the pastel colors of a new sunrise
or the saturated, rich colors of a sunset
it could be dark clouds that threaten snow
or no clouds at all
just a bright, clear blue sky of a brisk day

Paint the sky
make it as dramatic
or serene as you wish
again, allow the piece to dry
study it from a distance
endearing
