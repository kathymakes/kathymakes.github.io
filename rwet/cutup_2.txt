In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water
Add the sugar, salt, oil and 3 cups flour
Beat until smooth
Stir in enough remaining flour
1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough
Turn onto a floured surface;
knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes
Place in a greased bowl,
turning once to grease the top
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours
Punch dough down
Turn onto a lightly floured surface;
divide dough in half
Shape each into a loaf
Place in two greased 9x5-in loaf pans
Cover and let rise until doubled, 30-45 minutes
Bake at 375Â° for 30-35 minutes
or until golden brown
and bread sounds hollow when tapped
Remove from pans to wire racks to cool
Yield: 2 loaves (16 slices each)
